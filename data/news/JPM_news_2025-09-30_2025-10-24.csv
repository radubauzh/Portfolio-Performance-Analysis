Note: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> For the 99 S&P 500 members that have reported Q3 results, total earnings are up +13.7% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 86.9% beating EPS estimates and 81.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these 99 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 75.8%. For the Finance sector, we now have Q3 results from 54.5% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +23.0% from the same period last year on +12.0% higher revenues, with 97.0% beating EPS estimates and 87.9% beating revenue estimates. The Finance sector's Q3 earnings performance is tracking significantly above what we have seen from the sector in other recent periods, both in terms of the earnings and revenue growth pace as well as the beats percentages. In fact, the sector's Q3 revenue beats percentage of 87.9% is the highest for this group of companies over the preceding 20-quarter period. The above-average beats percentages at this stage of the Q3 reporting cycle are notable in light of the favorable revisions trend that was in place ahead of the start of this earnings season. In other words, actual Finance sector results came in ahead of expectations that had already moved up before these results came in. American Express AXP became the latest Finance player to beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates, also offering positive, reassuring commentary on the health of the consumer and the broader economy. The American Express results followed similar results and commentary from the likes of JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFC and others. The economic read-through from these bank results is reassuring and positive, notwithstanding worries about non-bank lenders following a few bankruptcies. Consumer spending and household financials remain stable on the back of a labor market that remains very strong. There are signs of improving credit demand, and delinquencies are off their highs, references to 'cockroaches' notwithstanding. Importantly, the capital markets business has finally started showing results, after many quarters of management teams describing improving deal pipelines. We are still at low levels relative to history. But given the favorable regulatory and monetary policy backdrop, it is reasonable to get excited about the sector's Wall Street business. For the 54.5% of the sector's market capitalization that have reported Q3 results, total earnings and revenues are up +23.0% and +12.0%, respectively, and 97.0% are beating EPS estimates and 87.9% are beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these Finance sector companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 87.9%. For the Zacks Finance sector as a whole, Q3 earnings are expected to increase by +23.4% from the same period last year on +7.8% higher revenues. Positive Q3 results and reassuring management commentary from these banks are helping sustain the favorable revisions trend that has been in place lately. For 2025 Q3, the expectation is for earnings growth of +7.3% on +6.7% revenue gains. We have consistently shown in this space how Q3 estimates have steadily increased since the quarter began. The aforementioned favorable revisions trend validates the market's rebound from the April lows. However, the trend can only be sustained if Q3 earnings results and management guidance for Q4 and beyond confirm it.

Management credited higher asset management and investment banking fees, as well as increased payment activity, for powering revenue expansion. CFO Jeremy Barnum noted, “Revenue was up predominantly driven by higher markets revenue as well as higher fees across asset management, investment banking, and payment.” While credit costs increased, largely due to a few isolated incidents in wholesale lending, overall credit performance in both wholesale and consumer businesses remained in line with expectations. Is now the time to buy JPM? Find out in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members). Revenue: $47.12 billion vs analyst estimates of $45.28 billion (8.8% year-on-year growth, 4.1% beat) Adjusted EPS: $5.07 vs analyst estimates of $4.87 (4% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $19.44 billion vs analyst estimates of $21.07 billion (41.2% margin, 7.7% miss) Market Capitalization: $823.1 billion While we enjoy listening to the management's commentary, our favorite part of earnings calls are the analyst questions. Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention. John McDonald (Truist Securities) inquired about deposit growth expectations given flat balances this quarter. CFO Jeremy Barnum explained that ongoing account acquisition remains strong but macro factors have delayed average balance inflection points. Glenn Schorr (Evercore ISI) asked about credit fundamentals in wholesale lending, especially differences between public and private markets. Barnum responded that recent charge-offs were isolated and the overall portfolio mix may lead to modestly higher expected losses in the future. Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley) questioned commercial loan reserve methodology as the portfolio mix evolves. Barnum said new direct lending deals bring higher day-one reserves, while overall reserve intensity will depend on specific deal characteristics. Ebrahim Poonawala (Bank of America) pressed on expense outlook and AI-driven productivity. Barnum noted that while AI-related efficiencies are expected, the primary focus remains on traditional expense discipline and process improvements. Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo Securities) sought clarity on risks related to non-bank financial institution lending. Barnum and CEO Jamie Dimon emphasized conservative underwriting practices and noted most exposure is highly secured, though they acknowledged areas of potential risk in a downturn. In future quarters, the StockStory team will focus on (1) trends in deposit growth and consumer spending resilience, (2) normalization in wholesale and consumer credit quality, especially as labor market conditions evolve, and (3) the impact of ongoing expense discipline and AI-driven productivity initiatives on cost growth. Progress in capital markets activity and continued net inflows in asset and wealth management will also be key markers for tracking execution.

The bottom line increased 23% from the prior-year quarter. Results have been aided by growth in fee revenues and lower provisions. Also, the company witnessed improvements in the total assets under custody and administration (AUC/A) and assets under management (AUM) balances. However, higher expenses and lower net interest income (NII) acted as spoilsports. Net income available to common shareholders was $802 million, up 17.6% from the year-ago quarter. Our projection for the metric was $698.1 million. Total revenues of $3.55 billion increased 8.8% year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.47 billion. NII was $715 million, down 1.1% year over year. The fall was due to lower average short-end rates and deposit mix shift, partially offset by securities portfolio repricing and continued loan growth. Our estimate for the metric was $738.2 million. The net interest margin (NIM) contracted 11 basis points year over year to 0.96%. We expected NIM to be 0.99%. Total fee revenues increased 8.1% year over year to $2.83 billion. The rise was driven by an increase in almost all the components, except for lending-related and other fees. We estimated the metric to be $2.70 billion. Non-interest expenses were $2.43 billion, up 5.5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to an increase in all components, except for the amortization of other intangible assets. Our estimate for non-interest expenses was $2.43 billion. Provision for credit losses was $9 million, down 65.4% from the prior-year quarter. We had projected the metric to be $20.4 million. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.3% as of Sept. 30, 2025, compared with 11.6% in the corresponding period of 2024. The return on average common equity was 13.4% compared with 12% in the year-ago quarter. As of Sept. 30, 2025, the total AUC/A was a record $51.66 trillion, up 10.5% year over year. The rise was driven by higher quarter-end equity market levels and client flows. We had projected the metric to be $52.04 trillion. AUM was $5.45 trillion, up 15.1% year over year, led by higher quarter-end market levels and net inflows. Our estimate for the metric was $5.55 trillion. In the reported quarter, State Street repurchased shares worth $400 million. Relatively higher interest rates, strategic buyouts, rising AUM and solid business servicing wins are expected to keep supporting STT’s financials. However, persistently rising expenses and concentrated fee-based revenues are concerning. State Street Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | State Street Corporation Quote State Street currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . Impressive trading and investment banking (IB) performance drove JPMorgan ’s JPM third-quarter 2025 earnings of $5.07 per share. The bottom line handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.83. JPM’s markets revenues exceeded management's expectations of growth in the high-teens percentage rate. The metric grew 25% year over year to $8.9 billion. Specifically, fixed-income markets’ revenues jumped 21% to $5.6 billion, while equity markets’ numbers increased 33% to $3.3 billion. Also, the IB business performance was far stronger than that expected by management. JPMorgan recorded an increase in NII, driven by higher yields and a 7% year-over-year jump in total loans. Citigroup Inc. C reported third-quarter 2025 adjusted net income per share of $2.24, up 48.3% from the year-ago period. The metric also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.3%. Citigroup’s results benefited from an increase in NII and non-interest revenues, alongside lower provisions. The company also registered a year-over-year increase of 17% in IB revenues, reflecting growth in advisory and equity capital markets. However, increased expenses and a weak capital position were the undermining factors for Citigroup. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start. As of Nov. 7, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data , and analysts are expecting a 13.1% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year. Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30. Last week, investors heard from tech and AI players such as Palantir ( PLTR ), AMD ( AMD ), Supermicro ( SMCI ), and Constellation Energy ( CEG ), as well as from Uber ( UBER ), Spotify ( SPOT ), Snap ( SNAP ), and Airbnb ( ABNB ). This week, quarterly results will arrive from The Walt Disney Company, Applied Materials ( AMAT ), CoreWeave, Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ), Rocket Lab ( RKLB ), Oklo ( OKLO ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), and Alibaba ( BABA ), among others. Here are the latest updates from corporate America. For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click here Monday.com ( MNDY ) stock shed 20% in premarket trading after the cloud-based project management software maker issued a softer than expected outlook. For the December quarter, the company expects $329 million in revenue, below the average analyst expectation of $333 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That overshadowed Monday.com's earnings beat, with profits tallying $0.25 per share, versus $0.18 expected. Revenue during the third quarter also came in above expectations, with the company recording $316 million in revenue versus $312 million estimated. The stock was already under pressure. Year to date, shares are off by more than 19% before factoring Monday's premarket losses. Maplebear Inc., doing business as Instacart ( CART ), reported strong top- and bottom-line results as online grocery orders surged in the third quarter. GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 topped Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate of $0.50 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue jumped to $939 million, above estimates of $933 million. Instacart said its orders grew 14% year over year to 83.4 million, driving revenue growth, even as the average order value decreased 4% year over year. Transaction revenue and advertising revenue both grew 10% to $670 million and $269 million, respectively. For the fourth quarter, Instacart expects adjusted EBITDA of $285 million to $295 million, which has a midpoint higher than the Street's estimated $288 million. Instacart stock popped over 8% in premarket trading. The peak portion of the third quarter earnings season is behind us. To recap, investors heard from Robinhood ( HOOD ), Palantir ( PLTR ), AMD ( AMD ), Moderna ( MRNA ), Duolingo ( DUOL ), Snap ( SNAP ), and many others, which you can read more about in the blogs below. In the next week, Disney ( DIS ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), Oklo ( OKLO ), and Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) will highlight the calendar. Although there have been some dramatic drawdowns in individual names so far this earnings season, on the whole, companies have reported more positive earnings surprises than negative ones. FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters has the report card : With 91% of S&P 500 companies having reported third quarter results so far, 82% of companies have reported a positive earnings surprise and 77% of companies have reported a positive revenue surprise. And the earnings growth rate for Q3 now appears on track to increase from the second quarter, at 13.1%. As for the trends this season, some are a continuation from last quarter. Tariffs continue to be top of mind for corporate leaders, and tech enthusiasm centered around artificial intelligence continues to fuel momentum, as my colleague Hamza Shaban alluded to earlier this week. But other cracks have emerged. Several consumer-facing companies have noted that affordability and sentiment pressures are starting to take a toll. And mentions of the government shutdown have spiked, though in many cases just for executives to iterate that they're seeing little to no impact. Constellation Energy ( CEG ) stock fell nearly 6% ahead of the market open after the energy provider reported earnings that missed expectations and narrowed its full-year operating earnings guidance. In Q3, Constellation posted GAAP earnings per share of $2.97, which missed analyst estimates of $3.05, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, revenue of $6.57 billion exceeded analysts' average estimate of $6.46 billion. Constellation also narrowed its full-year adjusted operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 on either end to a new range of $9.05–$9.45 per share. Previously, Constellation had been guiding for operating earnings guidance in a range of $8.90-$9.60 per share. Constellation's nuclear fleet produced 46,477 gigawatt-hours (GWhs) in the third quarter, compared with 45,510 GWhs in Q3 2024, achieving a 96.8% capacity factor, compared with 95.% for the same period a year ago. Year to date, Constellation Energy's stock is up 57%. Wendy's revenue and same-restaurant sales dipped in the third quarter, but the stock climbed 9% in premarket trading, as the declines weren't as bad as analysts feared. In Q3, Wendy's reported revenue of $549 million, a 3% decline from the same period a year ago but higher than the Street's estimate of $534 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Global same-restaurant sales also dropped by 3.7%, which was not as steep as analysts had anticipated. Earnings per share of $0.24 topped estimates for $0.20 per share. Wendy's international business helped offset declines in US consumer spending, while franchise fees helped bolster revenue. Read more here from Investing.com. Shares in Block ( XYZ ) fell 15% before the bell on Friday after the fintech company, which is owned by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, released earnings on Thursday which caused concern among investors due to Block's payment unit, Square, and its profitability. Reuters reports: Read more here. The AP reports Read more here. Sweetgreen ( SG ) missed earnings estimates as fewer consumers ordered salad bowls in the third quarter. The company reported a net loss of $0.31 on $172.3 million in revenue, below expectations for a loss of $0.18 per share on $177.8 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Traffic declined 11.7% year over year, which the company attributed to ""a slowdown in consumer spending within the macroeconomic environment"" and a shift in its loyalty program. Additionally, the fast-casual restaurant chain announced the sale of Spyce, which created the Infinite Kitchen makeline, to Wonder for $186.4 million. Sweetgreen will continue to use Spyce's Infinite Kitchen technology in its kitchens as part of the partnership. Sweetgreen stock fell over 8% in after-hours trading. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street's expectations on Thursday, sending the stock 10% lower in after-hours trading. In the third quarter, Block reported earnings per share of $0.54 on revenue of $6.11 billion. That's compared to estimates of $0.68 per share on revenue of $6.31 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The fintech company, known for its Square point-of-sale systems and Cash App, has increasingly been leaning into crypto and integrating bitcoin transactions into its services. In his shareholder letter, Dorsey said that Square bitcoin, which will enable merchants to accept bitcoin payments, will be rolled out this month. In the third quarter, Square's gross profit rose 9% to $1.01 billion, while Cash App gross profit grew 24% to $1.6 billion. For the full year, Block forecast gross profit of $10.24 billion, assuming year-over-year growth of 15%, which was slightly above its full-year outlook issued last quarter of $10.17 billion. New Opendoor ( OPEN ) CEO Kaz Nejatian outlined a path to profitability on Thursday as the real estate iBuyer seeks to return to profitability. The former Shopify COO, who joined Opendoor in September, laid out three objectives in the company's turnaround: transacting with more sellers, strengthening unit economics, and driving operational efficiency. Nejatian promised adjusted net income would break even by the end of 2026. ""We are refounding Opendoor as a software and AI company,"" Nejatian said. ""In my first month as CEO, we've made a decisive break from the past — returning to the office, eliminating reliance on consultants, and launching over a dozen AI-powered products and features that demonstrate our renewed velocity. Our business will succeed by building technology that makes selling, buying, and owning a home easier and more joyful — not from charging high spreads and hoping the macro saves us.” The strategy was presented along with Opendoor's third quarter results, which missed earnings estimates but beat on revenue. Opendoor reported revenue of $915 million, its lowest quarterly revenue since Q4 2023 but above Wall Street's expectations for $882 million. A loss per share of $0.12 during the quarter was wider than the expected $0.07 loss, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus estimates. For the fourth quarter, Opendoor expects similar declines. The company stated that its adjusted EBITDA loss for Q4 2025 is expected to be in the high-$40 million to mid-$50 million range. Analysts estimated Q4 EBITDA at a loss of $41 million. The stock has been one of the most active tickers this year, as retail investor and meme trade interest has sparked strong moves in the stock. Thursday's post-earnings move was no different, as the stock fell 4% in after-hours trading. Year to date, shares of Opendoor have soared 324%, but the stock is down by 26% in the past month. Airbnb ( ABNB ) stock jumped 5% in extended trading as international bookings buoyed revenue growth in the third quarter. Here's what the vacation rental company reported in its third quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence: In terms of bookings, Airbnb said it saw mid-single digit growth in North America, while bookings grew by mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East, low-20s growth in Latin America (particularly driven by Brazil bookings), and mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific. Overall, Airbnb reported 133.6 million nights and seats booked during the quarter, a 9% increase compared to the same period a year ago. ""During Q3 2025, we saw relatively consistent booking behavior by our guests in terms of market type, travel corridor, and length of stay compared to the same prior-year period,"" the company said in a statement. ""Average lead times were up slightly on a year-over-year basis, particularly in North America in part driven by the launch of our Reserve Now, Pay Later offering."" Listen to Airbnb's earnings call here at 5 p.m. ET. Under Armour ( UAA , UA ) shares sank on Thursday after the athletic apparel retailer swung to a net loss in its second quarter and forecast declining revenue for its fiscal year 2026. For the quarter, Under Armour reported a loss per share of $0.04 on revenue of $1.33 billion. Wall Street analysts were modeling for a loss of $0.02 on revenue of $1.30 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Net sales declined 4.7% year over year, driven by decreases in all categories, which the company attributed to ""ongoing pressure from a challenging consumer demand environment."" Under Armour expects revenue to decline 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. Apparel sales fell 1.1%, due to softness in the run, outdoor, and golf categories. Footwear sales fell 15.7%, and accessories sales dropped 2.8%, compared to the same period in 2024. Gross margin also declined by 250 basis points to 47.3%, ""mainly due to supply chain headwinds, driven by increased tariffs, and a less favorable channel and regional mix,"" the company said. “We don't have a brand problem,"" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank stressed on the company's earnings call. ""And we don't believe we have a product problem. ... But we certainly have a story opportunity. We haven't connected those things. We put a shoe out there like the Assert. We just never told anybody why they should buy it."" Under Armour also announced that Samsonite executive Reza Taleghani will replace 21-year corporate veteran David Bergman as CFO in February 2026. Reuters reports: Read more here. ConocoPhillips ( COP ) stock advanced 0.9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the oil and gas company raised its full-year forecast for production and lowered its outlook for costs. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 beat estimates of $1.41, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Conoco also raised its fourth quarter dividend by 8% to $0.84 per share. The Houston-based company raised its 2025 production guidance to 2.375 MMBOED (millions of barrels of oil equivalent per day), compared to its prior guidance of 2.35 million to 2.37 million barrels of oil per day. ConocoPhillips also lowered its full-year adjusted operating cost to $10.6 billion, compared to prior guidance of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. However, it updated the total project capital for the Willow project, which is an oil drilling site in Alaska, to $8.5 billion to $9 billion. Biotech company Moderna ( MRNA ) posted another net loss in the third quarter as COVID vaccine sales declined; however, the loss was much smaller than analysts expected, and the stock popped 6% in premarket trading. The company reported revenue of $1 billion, a 45% decrease from the $1.9 billion in revenue it reported in Q3 2024. That was primarily driven by a substantial decrease in COVID vaccine sales and other product sales. Moderna reported $971 million in COVID vaccine sales in Q3, with $781 million in US sales and $190 million in international sales. That led to a loss per share of $0.51 for the quarter. However, Wall Street was expecting a much wider loss of $2.18 per share. Moderna has been aggressively cutting costs. Its research and development expenses were down 30% year over year, while the cost of sales decreased 60%. ""We remain highly focused on operational excellence and financial discipline to advance our pipeline and expand the reach of our commercial portfolio,"" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. For the full year, Moderna narrowed its revenue guidance range. It now sees 2025 revenue in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. It previously guided for revenue to be between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion. Reuters reports: Read more here. E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ( ELF ) shares fell more than 21% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company posted a disappointing 2026 full-year outlook. The company expects net sales to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion, below Wall Street's expectations of $1.65 billion, per Bloomberg consensus data. It also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, also far lower than the expected $3.53. It expects net sales growth of approximately 18% to 20%. CFO Mandy Fields attributed the weaker outlook to tariffs, which ""assumes that the 45% tariff rate stays in place for the remainder of our fiscal year."" On a call with investors, she said, ""We estimate every 10 percentage points of incremental tariffs results in a $17 million growth impact to our cost of goods sold on an annualized basis before any mitigating actions."" She added, ""While tariff rates remain volatile, we believe the lead time of our supply chain gives us greater visibility into our costs for the second half of the year."" The stock fell as much as 30% before paring some of those losses. In the company's latest quarter, it posted mixed results. Adjusted earnings beat estimates at $0.68 per share, while revenue came in at $342.9 million, short of Wall Street's expected $365.7 million. Figma saw its shares rise along with its annual revenue forecast, which was boosted by the success of the company's AI tools and design software. Reuters reports: Read more here. Chime Financial ( CHYM ) reported annual revenue growth of 29% in the September quarter, highlighting resilient consumer spending on essentials in the US. The fintech company, which provides digital consumer banking and payment services, including checking and savings accounts, reported revenue of $544 million.

So far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start. As of Nov. 7, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data , and analysts are expecting a 13.1% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year. Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30. Last week, investors heard from tech and AI players such as Palantir ( PLTR ), AMD ( AMD ), Supermicro ( SMCI ), and Constellation Energy ( CEG ), as well as from Uber ( UBER ), Spotify ( SPOT ), Snap ( SNAP ), and Airbnb ( ABNB ). This week, quarterly results will arrive from The Walt Disney Company, Applied Materials ( AMAT ), CoreWeave, Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ), Rocket Lab ( RKLB ), Oklo ( OKLO ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), and Alibaba ( BABA ), among others. Here are the latest updates from corporate America. For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click here Monday.com ( MNDY ) stock shed 20% in premarket trading after the cloud-based project management software maker issued a softer than expected outlook. For the December quarter, the company expects $329 million in revenue, below the average analyst expectation of $333 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That overshadowed Monday.com's earnings beat, with profits tallying $0.25 per share, versus $0.18 expected. Revenue during the third quarter also came in above expectations, with the company recording $316 million in revenue versus $312 million estimated. The stock was already under pressure. Year to date, shares are off by more than 19% before factoring Monday's premarket losses. Maplebear Inc., doing business as Instacart ( CART ), reported strong top- and bottom-line results as online grocery orders surged in the third quarter. GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 topped Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate of $0.50 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue jumped to $939 million, above estimates of $933 million. Instacart said its orders grew 14% year over year to 83.4 million, driving revenue growth, even as the average order value decreased 4% year over year. Transaction revenue and advertising revenue both grew 10% to $670 million and $269 million, respectively. For the fourth quarter, Instacart expects adjusted EBITDA of $285 million to $295 million, which has a midpoint higher than the Street's estimated $288 million. Instacart stock popped over 8% in premarket trading. The peak portion of the third quarter earnings season is behind us. To recap, investors heard from Robinhood ( HOOD ), Palantir ( PLTR ), AMD ( AMD ), Moderna ( MRNA ), Duolingo ( DUOL ), Snap ( SNAP ), and many others, which you can read more about in the blogs below. In the next week, Disney ( DIS ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), Oklo ( OKLO ), and Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) will highlight the calendar. Although there have been some dramatic drawdowns in individual names so far this earnings season, on the whole, companies have reported more positive earnings surprises than negative ones. FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters has the report card : With 91% of S&P 500 companies having reported third quarter results so far, 82% of companies have reported a positive earnings surprise and 77% of companies have reported a positive revenue surprise. And the earnings growth rate for Q3 now appears on track to increase from the second quarter, at 13.1%. As for the trends this season, some are a continuation from last quarter. Tariffs continue to be top of mind for corporate leaders, and tech enthusiasm centered around artificial intelligence continues to fuel momentum, as my colleague Hamza Shaban alluded to earlier this week. But other cracks have emerged. Several consumer-facing companies have noted that affordability and sentiment pressures are starting to take a toll. And mentions of the government shutdown have spiked, though in many cases just for executives to iterate that they're seeing little to no impact. Constellation Energy ( CEG ) stock fell nearly 6% ahead of the market open after the energy provider reported earnings that missed expectations and narrowed its full-year operating earnings guidance. In Q3, Constellation posted GAAP earnings per share of $2.97, which missed analyst estimates of $3.05, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, revenue of $6.57 billion exceeded analysts' average estimate of $6.46 billion. Constellation also narrowed its full-year adjusted operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 on either end to a new range of $9.05–$9.45 per share. Previously, Constellation had been guiding for operating earnings guidance in a range of $8.90-$9.60 per share. Constellation's nuclear fleet produced 46,477 gigawatt-hours (GWhs) in the third quarter, compared with 45,510 GWhs in Q3 2024, achieving a 96.8% capacity factor, compared with 95.% for the same period a year ago. Year to date, Constellation Energy's stock is up 57%. Wendy's revenue and same-restaurant sales dipped in the third quarter, but the stock climbed 9% in premarket trading, as the declines weren't as bad as analysts feared. In Q3, Wendy's reported revenue of $549 million, a 3% decline from the same period a year ago but higher than the Street's estimate of $534 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Global same-restaurant sales also dropped by 3.7%, which was not as steep as analysts had anticipated. Earnings per share of $0.24 topped estimates for $0.20 per share. Wendy's international business helped offset declines in US consumer spending, while franchise fees helped bolster revenue. Read more here from Investing.com. Shares in Block ( XYZ ) fell 15% before the bell on Friday after the fintech company, which is owned by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, released earnings on Thursday which caused concern among investors due to Block's payment unit, Square, and its profitability. Reuters reports: Read more here. The AP reports Read more here. Sweetgreen ( SG ) missed earnings estimates as fewer consumers ordered salad bowls in the third quarter. The company reported a net loss of $0.31 on $172.3 million in revenue, below expectations for a loss of $0.18 per share on $177.8 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Traffic declined 11.7% year over year, which the company attributed to ""a slowdown in consumer spending within the macroeconomic environment"" and a shift in its loyalty program. Additionally, the fast-casual restaurant chain announced the sale of Spyce, which created the Infinite Kitchen makeline, to Wonder for $186.4 million. Sweetgreen will continue to use Spyce's Infinite Kitchen technology in its kitchens as part of the partnership. Sweetgreen stock fell over 8% in after-hours trading. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street's expectations on Thursday, sending the stock 10% lower in after-hours trading. In the third quarter, Block reported earnings per share of $0.54 on revenue of $6.11 billion. That's compared to estimates of $0.68 per share on revenue of $6.31 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The fintech company, known for its Square point-of-sale systems and Cash App, has increasingly been leaning into crypto and integrating bitcoin transactions into its services. In his shareholder letter, Dorsey said that Square bitcoin, which will enable merchants to accept bitcoin payments, will be rolled out this month. In the third quarter, Square's gross profit rose 9% to $1.01 billion, while Cash App gross profit grew 24% to $1.6 billion. For the full year, Block forecast gross profit of $10.24 billion, assuming year-over-year growth of 15%, which was slightly above its full-year outlook issued last quarter of $10.17 billion. New Opendoor ( OPEN ) CEO Kaz Nejatian outlined a path to profitability on Thursday as the real estate iBuyer seeks to return to profitability. The former Shopify COO, who joined Opendoor in September, laid out three objectives in the company's turnaround: transacting with more sellers, strengthening unit economics, and driving operational efficiency. Nejatian promised adjusted net income would break even by the end of 2026. ""We are refounding Opendoor as a software and AI company,"" Nejatian said. ""In my first month as CEO, we've made a decisive break from the past — returning to the office, eliminating reliance on consultants, and launching over a dozen AI-powered products and features that demonstrate our renewed velocity. Our business will succeed by building technology that makes selling, buying, and owning a home easier and more joyful — not from charging high spreads and hoping the macro saves us.” The strategy was presented along with Opendoor's third quarter results, which missed earnings estimates but beat on revenue. Opendoor reported revenue of $915 million, its lowest quarterly revenue since Q4 2023 but above Wall Street's expectations for $882 million. A loss per share of $0.12 during the quarter was wider than the expected $0.07 loss, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus estimates. For the fourth quarter, Opendoor expects similar declines. The company stated that its adjusted EBITDA loss for Q4 2025 is expected to be in the high-$40 million to mid-$50 million range. Analysts estimated Q4 EBITDA at a loss of $41 million. The stock has been one of the most active tickers this year, as retail investor and meme trade interest has sparked strong moves in the stock. Thursday's post-earnings move was no different, as the stock fell 4% in after-hours trading. Year to date, shares of Opendoor have soared 324%, but the stock is down by 26% in the past month. Airbnb ( ABNB ) stock jumped 5% in extended trading as international bookings buoyed revenue growth in the third quarter. Here's what the vacation rental company reported in its third quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence: In terms of bookings, Airbnb said it saw mid-single digit growth in North America, while bookings grew by mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East, low-20s growth in Latin America (particularly driven by Brazil bookings), and mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific. Overall, Airbnb reported 133.6 million nights and seats booked during the quarter, a 9% increase compared to the same period a year ago. ""During Q3 2025, we saw relatively consistent booking behavior by our guests in terms of market type, travel corridor, and length of stay compared to the same prior-year period,"" the company said in a statement. ""Average lead times were up slightly on a year-over-year basis, particularly in North America in part driven by the launch of our Reserve Now, Pay Later offering."" Listen to Airbnb's earnings call here at 5 p.m. ET. Under Armour ( UAA , UA ) shares sank on Thursday after the athletic apparel retailer swung to a net loss in its second quarter and forecast declining revenue for its fiscal year 2026. For the quarter, Under Armour reported a loss per share of $0.04 on revenue of $1.33 billion. Wall Street analysts were modeling for a loss of $0.02 on revenue of $1.30 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Net sales declined 4.7% year over year, driven by decreases in all categories, which the company attributed to ""ongoing pressure from a challenging consumer demand environment."" Under Armour expects revenue to decline 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. Apparel sales fell 1.1%, due to softness in the run, outdoor, and golf categories. Footwear sales fell 15.7%, and accessories sales dropped 2.8%, compared to the same period in 2024. Gross margin also declined by 250 basis points to 47.3%, ""mainly due to supply chain headwinds, driven by increased tariffs, and a less favorable channel and regional mix,"" the company said. “We don't have a brand problem,"" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank stressed on the company's earnings call. ""And we don't believe we have a product problem. ... But we certainly have a story opportunity. We haven't connected those things. We put a shoe out there like the Assert. We just never told anybody why they should buy it."" Under Armour also announced that Samsonite executive Reza Taleghani will replace 21-year corporate veteran David Bergman as CFO in February 2026.

ConocoPhillips ( COP ) stock advanced 0.9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the oil and gas company raised its full-year forecast for production and lowered its outlook for costs. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 beat estimates of $1.41, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Conoco also raised its fourth quarter dividend by 8% to $0.84 per share. The Houston-based company raised its 2025 production guidance to 2.375 MMBOED (millions of barrels of oil equivalent per day), compared to its prior guidance of 2.35 million to 2.37 million barrels of oil per day. ConocoPhillips also lowered its full-year adjusted operating cost to $10.6 billion, compared to prior guidance of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. However, it updated the total project capital for the Willow project, which is an oil drilling site in Alaska, to $8.5 billion to $9 billion. Biotech company Moderna ( MRNA ) posted another net loss in the third quarter as COVID vaccine sales declined; however, the loss was much smaller than analysts expected, and the stock popped 6% in premarket trading. The company reported revenue of $1 billion, a 45% decrease from the $1.9 billion in revenue it reported in Q3 2024. That was primarily driven by a substantial decrease in COVID vaccine sales and other product sales. Moderna reported $971 million in COVID vaccine sales in Q3, with $781 million in US sales and $190 million in international sales. That led to a loss per share of $0.51 for the quarter.

The bottom line reflected a 36.7% jump from the prior-year quarter. Shares of KeyCorp gained 1.4% in the early-market trading on better-than-expected results. A full day’s trading session will depict a clearer picture. Results primarily benefited from higher net interest income (NII) and a substantial rise in non-interest income. The average loan balance increased sequentially, which was another positive. However, higher expenses and a rise in provisions were the undermining factors. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders was $454 million, against a net loss of $447 million in the prior-year quarter. Total revenues increased significantly year over year to $1.89 billion. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.88 billion. NII (on a tax-equivalent or TE basis) increased 23.8% on a year-over-year basis to $1.19 billion. The net interest margin (NIM) (TE basis) from continuing operations expanded 58 basis points (bps) to 2.75%. Both metrics benefited from lower deposit costs, the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing low-yielding investment securities, fixed-rate loans and swaps repricing into higher-yielding investments, and the repositioning of the available-for-sale portfolio during the third and fourth quarters of 2024. These benefits were partially offset by the impacts of lower interest rates on variable-rate earning assets. Our estimates for NII (TE) and NIM were $1.17 billion and 2.71%, respectively. Non-interest income was $702 million, up significantly from the prior-year quarter. The rise was primarily driven by a 99.4% decline in net securities losses. In the third quarter of 2024, the company recorded a $918 million loss on the sale of securities as part of the strategic repositioning of portfolio, which had drastically hurt fee income. In the reported quarter, net securities losses were only $6 million. Our estimate for total non-interest income was $710.1 million. Non-interest expenses increased 7.4% year over year to $1.18 billion. The rise was due to an increase in almost all cost components except for operating lease expenses and net occupancy costs. We projected the metric to be $1.20 billion. At the end of the third quarter, average total loans were $106.23 billion, up marginally from the previous quarter. We had anticipated average total loans of $106.19 billion. Average total deposits were $150.37 billion, up 2% from the prior-quarter end. Our estimate for the metric was $148.31 billion. The provision for credit losses was $107 million, up 12.6% year over year. Our estimate for provision for credit losses was $105.7 million. However, net loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average total loans, declined 16 bps year over year to 0.42%. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $1.44 billion, down 3.3% from the prior-year quarter. Non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate-owned property assets, and other non-performing assets, were 0.63%, down 7 bps year over year. KEY's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.1% as of Sept. 30, 2025, up from 6.2% in the corresponding period of 2024. The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.5%, up from 12.6%. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.8%, up from 10.8% as of Sept. 30, 2024. Decent loan balances, balance sheet repositioning efforts, strategic buyouts and relatively higher interest rates will likely support KeyCorp’s revenues in the near term. Weakening asset quality amid a tough macroeconomic backdrop is concerning. KeyCorp price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | KeyCorp Quote KeyCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Impressive trading and investment banking (IB) performance drove JPMorgan ’s JPM third-quarter 2025 earnings of $5.07 per share. The bottom line handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.83. JPM’s markets revenues exceeded management's expectations of growth in the high-teens percentage rate. The metric grew 25% year over year to $8.9 billion. Specifically, fixed-income markets’ revenues jumped 21% to $5.6 billion, while equity markets’ numbers increased 33% to $3.3 billion. Also, the IB business performance was far stronger than that expected by management. JPMorgan recorded an increase in NII, driven by higher yields and a 7% year-over-year jump in total loans. Citigroup Inc. C reported third-quarter 2025 adjusted net income per share of $2.24, up 48.3% from the year-ago period. The metric also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.3%. Citigroup’s results benefited from an increase in NII and non-interest revenues, alongside lower provisions. The company also registered a year-over-year increase of 17% in IB revenues, reflecting growth in advisory and equity capital markets. However, increased expenses and a weak capital position were the undermining factors for Citigroup. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Instacart said its orders grew 14% year over year to 83.4 million, driving revenue growth, even as the average order value decreased 4% year over year. Transaction revenue and advertising revenue both grew 10% to $670 million and $269 million, respectively. For the fourth quarter, Instacart expects adjusted EBITDA of $285 million to $295 million, which has a midpoint higher than the Street's estimated $288 million. Instacart stock popped over 8% in premarket trading. The peak portion of the third quarter earnings season is behind us. To recap, investors heard from Robinhood ( HOOD ), Palantir ( PLTR ), AMD ( AMD ), Moderna ( MRNA ), Duolingo ( DUOL ), Snap ( SNAP ), and many others, which you can read more about in the blogs below. In the next week, Disney ( DIS ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), Oklo ( OKLO ), and Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) will highlight the calendar. Although there have been some dramatic drawdowns in individual names so far this earnings season, on the whole, companies have reported more positive earnings surprises than negative ones. FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters has the report card : With 91% of S&P 500 companies having reported third quarter results so far, 82% of companies have reported a positive earnings surprise and 77% of companies have reported a positive revenue surprise. And the earnings growth rate for Q3 now appears on track to increase from the second quarter, at 13.1%. As for the trends this season, some are a continuation from last quarter. Tariffs continue to be top of mind for corporate leaders, and tech enthusiasm centered around artificial intelligence continues to fuel momentum, as my colleague Hamza Shaban alluded to earlier this week. But other cracks have emerged. Several consumer-facing companies have noted that affordability and sentiment pressures are starting to take a toll. And mentions of the government shutdown have spiked, though in many cases just for executives to iterate that they're seeing little to no impact. Constellation Energy ( CEG ) stock fell nearly 6% ahead of the market open after the energy provider reported earnings that missed expectations and narrowed its full-year operating earnings guidance. In Q3, Constellation posted GAAP earnings per share of $2.97, which missed analyst estimates of $3.05, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, revenue of $6.57 billion exceeded analysts' average estimate of $6.46 billion. Constellation also narrowed its full-year adjusted operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 on either end to a new range of $9.05–$9.45 per share. Previously, Constellation had been guiding for operating earnings guidance in a range of $8.90-$9.60 per share. Constellation's nuclear fleet produced 46,477 gigawatt-hours (GWhs) in the third quarter, compared with 45,510 GWhs in Q3 2024, achieving a 96.8% capacity factor, compared with 95.% for the same period a year ago. Year to date, Constellation Energy's stock is up 57%. Wendy's revenue and same-restaurant sales dipped in the third quarter, but the stock climbed 9% in premarket trading, as the declines weren't as bad as analysts feared. In Q3, Wendy's reported revenue of $549 million, a 3% decline from the same period a year ago but higher than the Street's estimate of $534 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Global same-restaurant sales also dropped by 3.7%, which was not as steep as analysts had anticipated. Earnings per share of $0.24 topped estimates for $0.20 per share. Wendy's international business helped offset declines in US consumer spending, while franchise fees helped bolster revenue. Read more here from Investing.com. Shares in Block ( XYZ ) fell 15% before the bell on Friday after the fintech company, which is owned by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, released earnings on Thursday which caused concern among investors due to Block's payment unit, Square, and its profitability. Reuters reports: Read more here. The AP reports Read more here. Sweetgreen ( SG ) missed earnings estimates as fewer consumers ordered salad bowls in the third quarter. The company reported a net loss of $0.31 on $172.3 million in revenue, below expectations for a loss of $0.18 per share on $177.8 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Traffic declined 11.7% year over year, which the company attributed to ""a slowdown in consumer spending within the macroeconomic environment"" and a shift in its loyalty program. Additionally, the fast-casual restaurant chain announced the sale of Spyce, which created the Infinite Kitchen makeline, to Wonder for $186.4 million. Sweetgreen will continue to use Spyce's Infinite Kitchen technology in its kitchens as part of the partnership. Sweetgreen stock fell over 8% in after-hours trading. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street's expectations on Thursday, sending the stock 10% lower in after-hours trading. In the third quarter, Block reported earnings per share of $0.54 on revenue of $6.11 billion. That's compared to estimates of $0.68 per share on revenue of $6.31 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The fintech company, known for its Square point-of-sale systems and Cash App, has increasingly been leaning into crypto and integrating bitcoin transactions into its services. In his shareholder letter, Dorsey said that Square bitcoin, which will enable merchants to accept bitcoin payments, will be rolled out this month. In the third quarter, Square's gross profit rose 9% to $1.01 billion, while Cash App gross profit grew 24% to $1.6 billion. For the full year, Block forecast gross profit of $10.24 billion, assuming year-over-year growth of 15%, which was slightly above its full-year outlook issued last quarter of $10.17 billion. New Opendoor ( OPEN ) CEO Kaz Nejatian outlined a path to profitability on Thursday as the real estate iBuyer seeks to return to profitability. The former Shopify COO, who joined Opendoor in September, laid out three objectives in the company's turnaround: transacting with more sellers, strengthening unit economics, and driving operational efficiency. Nejatian promised adjusted net income would break even by the end of 2026. ""We are refounding Opendoor as a software and AI company,"" Nejatian said. ""In my first month as CEO, we've made a decisive break from the past — returning to the office, eliminating reliance on consultants, and launching over a dozen AI-powered products and features that demonstrate our renewed velocity. Our business will succeed by building technology that makes selling, buying, and owning a home easier and more joyful — not from charging high spreads and hoping the macro saves us.” The strategy was presented along with Opendoor's third quarter results, which missed earnings estimates but beat on revenue. Opendoor reported revenue of $915 million, its lowest quarterly revenue since Q4 2023 but above Wall Street's expectations for $882 million. A loss per share of $0.12 during the quarter was wider than the expected $0.07 loss, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus estimates. For the fourth quarter, Opendoor expects similar declines. The company stated that its adjusted EBITDA loss for Q4 2025 is expected to be in the high-$40 million to mid-$50 million range. Analysts estimated Q4 EBITDA at a loss of $41 million. The stock has been one of the most active tickers this year, as retail investor and meme trade interest has sparked strong moves in the stock. Thursday's post-earnings move was no different, as the stock fell 4% in after-hours trading. Year to date, shares of Opendoor have soared 324%, but the stock is down by 26% in the past month. Airbnb ( ABNB ) stock jumped 5% in extended trading as international bookings buoyed revenue growth in the third quarter. Here's what the vacation rental company reported in its third quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence: In terms of bookings, Airbnb said it saw mid-single digit growth in North America, while bookings grew by mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East, low-20s growth in Latin America (particularly driven by Brazil bookings), and mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific. Overall, Airbnb reported 133.6 million nights and seats booked during the quarter, a 9% increase compared to the same period a year ago. ""During Q3 2025, we saw relatively consistent booking behavior by our guests in terms of market type, travel corridor, and length of stay compared to the same prior-year period,"" the company said in a statement. ""Average lead times were up slightly on a year-over-year basis, particularly in North America in part driven by the launch of our Reserve Now, Pay Later offering."" Listen to Airbnb's earnings call here at 5 p.m. ET. Under Armour ( UAA , UA ) shares sank on Thursday after the athletic apparel retailer swung to a net loss in its second quarter and forecast declining revenue for its fiscal year 2026. For the quarter, Under Armour reported a loss per share of $0.04 on revenue of $1.33 billion. Wall Street analysts were modeling for a loss of $0.02 on revenue of $1.30 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Net sales declined 4.7% year over year, driven by decreases in all categories, which the company attributed to ""ongoing pressure from a challenging consumer demand environment."" Under Armour expects revenue to decline 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. Apparel sales fell 1.1%, due to softness in the run, outdoor, and golf categories. Footwear sales fell 15.7%, and accessories sales dropped 2.8%, compared to the same period in 2024. Gross margin also declined by 250 basis points to 47.3%, ""mainly due to supply chain headwinds, driven by increased tariffs, and a less favorable channel and regional mix,"" the company said. “We don't have a brand problem,"" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank stressed on the company's earnings call. ""And we don't believe we have a product problem. ... But we certainly have a story opportunity. We haven't connected those things. We put a shoe out there like the Assert. We just never told anybody why they should buy it."" Under Armour also announced that Samsonite executive Reza Taleghani will replace 21-year corporate veteran David Bergman as CFO in February 2026. Reuters reports: Read more here. ConocoPhillips ( COP ) stock advanced 0.9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the oil and gas company raised its full-year forecast for production and lowered its outlook for costs. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 beat estimates of $1.41, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Conoco also raised its fourth quarter dividend by 8% to $0.84 per share. The Houston-based company raised its 2025 production guidance to 2.375 MMBOED (millions of barrels of oil equivalent per day), compared to its prior guidance of 2.35 million to 2.37 million barrels of oil per day. ConocoPhillips also lowered its full-year adjusted operating cost to $10.6 billion, compared to prior guidance of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. However, it updated the total project capital for the Willow project, which is an oil drilling site in Alaska, to $8.5 billion to $9 billion. Biotech company Moderna ( MRNA ) posted another net loss in the third quarter as COVID vaccine sales declined; however, the loss was much smaller than analysts expected, and the stock popped 6% in premarket trading. The company reported revenue of $1 billion, a 45% decrease from the $1.9 billion in revenue it reported in Q3 2024. That was primarily driven by a substantial decrease in COVID vaccine sales and other product sales. Moderna reported $971 million in COVID vaccine sales in Q3, with $781 million in US sales and $190 million in international sales. That led to a loss per share of $0.51 for the quarter. However, Wall Street was expecting a much wider loss of $2.18 per share. Moderna has been aggressively cutting costs. Its research and development expenses were down 30% year over year, while the cost of sales decreased 60%. ""We remain highly focused on operational excellence and financial discipline to advance our pipeline and expand the reach of our commercial portfolio,"" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. For the full year, Moderna narrowed its revenue guidance range. It now sees 2025 revenue in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. It previously guided for revenue to be between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion. Reuters reports: Read more here. E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ( ELF ) shares fell more than 21% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company posted a disappointing 2026 full-year outlook. The company expects net sales to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion, below Wall Street's expectations of $1.65 billion, per Bloomberg consensus data. It also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, also far lower than the expected $3.53. It expects net sales growth of approximately 18% to 20%. CFO Mandy Fields attributed the weaker outlook to tariffs, which ""assumes that the 45% tariff rate stays in place for the remainder of our fiscal year."" On a call with investors, she said, ""We estimate every 10 percentage points of incremental tariffs results in a $17 million growth impact to our cost of goods sold on an annualized basis before any mitigating actions."" She added, ""While tariff rates remain volatile, we believe the lead time of our supply chain gives us greater visibility into our costs for the second half of the year."" The stock fell as much as 30% before paring some of those losses. In the company's latest quarter, it posted mixed results. Adjusted earnings beat estimates at $0.68 per share, while revenue came in at $342.9 million, short of Wall Street's expected $365.7 million. Figma saw its shares rise along with its annual revenue forecast, which was boosted by the success of the company's AI tools and design software. Reuters reports: Read more here. Chime Financial ( CHYM ) reported annual revenue growth of 29% in the September quarter, highlighting resilient consumer spending on essentials in the US. The fintech company, which provides digital consumer banking and payment services, including checking and savings accounts, reported revenue of $544 million. Chime also raised its full-year forecast as it sees a surge of new members. Chime stock increased 5% in after-hours trading following the results. Reuters reports: Read more here.

Also, the bottom line soared 49% from the prior-year quarter. Shares of Morgan Stanley jumped almost 4.5% in pre-market trading as it became the latest Wall Street giant to gain from a surge in dealmaking activities during the quarter. Like its Wall Street peers, Morgan Stanley’s investment banking (IB) business gained from a frenzy of deal-making activities and IPOs. Advisory fees jumped 25% year over year as completed M&A transactions rose. Further, higher non-investment grade and investment grade issuances supported the company’s fixed income underwriting fees, which surged 39%. Moreover, equity underwriting income soared 80% “as clients actively engaged in capital-raising opportunities.” Hence, total IB fees (in the Institutional Securities division) increased 44% to $2.11 billion. We had projected it to be $1.54 billion. Similarly, MS posted a solid trading performance. Equity trading revenues climbed 35% year over year to $4.12 billion and fixed-income trading income was up 8% to $2.17 billion. Our projections for equity and fixed-income trading revenues were $3.56 billion and $2.11 billion, respectively. Further, the performance of the company’s wealth management and investment management businesses was impressive, driven by a rise in client assets and assets under management. Morgan Stanley’s net interest income (NII) increased, given the improved lending activities. On the other hand, an increase in total non-interest expenses was the undermining factor. Net income applicable to common shareholders was $4.45 billion, an increase of 47% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $3.12 billion. Quarterly net revenues were $18.22 billion, surging 18% from the prior-year quarter. The top line handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.4 billion. NII was $2.49 billion, up 13%. We had projected NII of $2.31 billion. Total non-interest revenues of $15.73 billion jumped 19%. Our estimate for the metric was $13.56 billion. Total non-interest expenses were $12.2 billion, up 10%. Our estimate for the metric was $11.44 billion. Provision for credit losses was nil compared with $79 million in the prior-year quarter. We had projected the metric to be $85.3 million. Institutional Securities: Pre-tax income was $3.18 billion, jumping 67% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same was $2.25 billion. Net revenues were $8.52 billion, up 25% year over year. The upside resulted from increased equity and fixed income trading revenues and higher IB net revenues. We had projected segment net revenues of $7.44 billion. Wealth Management: Pre-tax income totaled $2.5 billion, rising 21% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $1.87 billion. Net revenues were $8.23 billion, up 13%, driven by higher asset management revenues, transactional revenues and NII. We had projected revenues of $7.14 billion. Total client assets were $7.05 trillion as of Sept. 30, 2025, up 18% year over year. We had projected the metric to be $6.4 trillion. Investment Management: Pre-tax income was $364 million, climbing 40% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the same was $243.2 million. Net revenues were $1.65 billion, growing 13%. The improvement was attributable to a rise in asset management and related fees, and performance-based income and other revenues. We had projected revenues of $1.46 billion. As of Sept. 30, 2025, total assets under management or supervision were $1.81 trillion, up 13% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $1.75 trillion. As of Sept. 30, 2025, book value per share was $62.98, up from $58.25 in the corresponding period of 2024. The tangible book value per share was $48.64, up from $43.76 as of Sept. 30, 2024. Morgan Stanley’s Tier 1 capital ratio (advanced approach) was 17.6% compared with 16.9% in the year-ago quarter. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.7% compared with 14.9% a year ago. In the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley repurchased 7 billion shares for $1.1 billion. The rebound of the IB business and a solid deal-making pipeline are expected to support Morgan Stanley’s financials. Efforts to become less dependent on capital markets-driven revenues and inorganic expansion/strategic alliances will support top-line growth. However, elevated expenses due to expansion efforts and volatile trading revenues are concerns.

Looking ahead, analysts expect annual revenue to grow at 4.4% and earnings at just 0.7%, with both figures trailing the broader US market’s outlook. Investors are weighing JPMorgan’s enhanced profitability and five-year earnings track record against softer forward growth expectations and higher trading multiples compared to industry peers. See our full analysis for JPMorgan Chase. Next up, we’ll see how these headline figures compare to the commonly held narratives around JPMorgan, highlighting where consensus is confirmed and where surprises emerge. See what the community is saying about JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan posted a current net profit margin of 33.9%, higher than its prior year's 32.1% and surpassing the US Banks industry average margin, signaling relative strength in core banking operations. Heavily supports the bullish narrative that scale advantages and digital leadership continue to drive extraordinary profitability, even as fintech and technology investments grow. The bullish view highlights JPMorgan’s ability to achieve industry-beating margin expansion. Rising margins this year back that up, especially as peers struggle with cost pressures. What’s especially notable is that despite higher technology and compliance spending, JPMorgan not only protected but expanded its net margin, reinforcing bullish arguments for durable efficiency gains. Bulls argue there’s still more upside if technology and market leadership keep pulling margins higher. 🐂 JPMorgan Chase Bull Case Forward guidance points to annual revenue growth of only 4.4% and earnings growth of just 0.7%, both well below the US market’s forecasted 10% and 15.5% respectively. Bears argue this soft growth outlook challenges JPMorgan’s ability to sustain premium valuation multiples as sector headwinds intensify. The bearish case calls out risk from anticipated rate cuts and heightened expenses. JPMorgan’s modest earnings and revenue forecasts directly support bear concerns about shrinking growth runway. On top of that, higher costs and a larger allowance for credit losses signal that pressure on both net and operating margins could persist, limiting room for upside surprises. Bears warn that slowing growth and higher costs could derail the premium story if economic risks persist. 🐻 JPMorgan Chase Bear Case Shares trade at a Price-To-Earnings ratio of 14.7x, noticeably above the 11.7x industry average, yet remain below their DCF fair value of $340.99 (recent share price: $302.08). Analysts’ consensus view points to the stock’s unique valuation position: while JPMorgan commands a sizable premium to most peers, its robust net margin and strong fundamentals leave shares still trading below intrinsic value. This suggests opportunity for value-focused investors, but also underscores how much has to go right to justify an even higher multiple. Consensus narrative notes that some premium is justified thanks to consistent outperformance and attractive dividend profile, but slower projected growth means there is less margin for error than in previous cycles. Bulls and bears alike agree that the current valuation relies heavily on JPMorgan delivering on technology-led productivity and continued fee income expansion, both of which have to play out amid a tougher macro backdrop.

Consistent earnings growth is essential for all companies since survival depends on profitability. Earnings are also regarded as the most important factor influencing share prices. However, expectations of earnings play a significant role. Nonetheless, stocks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, Commvault Systems, Inc . CVLT and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation WAB are currently showing excellent earnings growth. We have frequently seen a decline in stock prices despite earnings growth, followed by a rally in prices after an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations. Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess a firm's cash flow to determine its fair value. Thus, investors should be on the lookout for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates. To shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters: Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.) 5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history). % Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal). % Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks). % Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week). % Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks). The above criteria narrowed the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 16. Here are the top three stocks: JPMorgan is a global financial services company involved in consumer banking, investment banking and asset management. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the next five years is 7.9%. JPM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Commvault Systems offers a cyber resilience platform for data and cloud-native application protection globally. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.4%.

So far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start. As of Nov. 7, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data , and analysts are expecting a 13.1% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year. Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30. Last week, investors heard from tech and AI players such as Palantir ( PLTR ), AMD ( AMD ), Supermicro ( SMCI ), and Constellation Energy ( CEG ), as well as from Uber ( UBER ), Spotify ( SPOT ), Snap ( SNAP ), and Airbnb ( ABNB ). This week, quarterly results will arrive from The Walt Disney Company, Applied Materials ( AMAT ), CoreWeave, Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ), Rocket Lab ( RKLB ), Oklo ( OKLO ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), and Alibaba ( BABA ), among others.

For the December quarter, the company expects $329 million in revenue, below the average analyst expectation of $333 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That overshadowed Monday.com's earnings beat, with profits tallying $0.25 per share, versus $0.18 expected. Revenue during the third quarter also came in above expectations, with the company recording $316 million in revenue versus $312 million estimated. The stock was already under pressure.

In the next week, Disney ( DIS ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), Oklo ( OKLO ), and Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) will highlight the calendar. Although there have been some dramatic drawdowns in individual names so far this earnings season, on the whole, companies have reported more positive earnings surprises than negative ones. FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters has the report card : With 91% of S&P 500 companies having reported third quarter results so far, 82% of companies have reported a positive earnings surprise and 77% of companies have reported a positive revenue surprise. And the earnings growth rate for Q3 now appears on track to increase from the second quarter, at 13.1%. As for the trends this season, some are a continuation from last quarter. Tariffs continue to be top of mind for corporate leaders, and tech enthusiasm centered around artificial intelligence continues to fuel momentum, as my colleague Hamza Shaban alluded to earlier this week. But other cracks have emerged. Several consumer-facing companies have noted that affordability and sentiment pressures are starting to take a toll. And mentions of the government shutdown have spiked, though in many cases just for executives to iterate that they're seeing little to no impact. Constellation Energy ( CEG ) stock fell nearly 6% ahead of the market open after the energy provider reported earnings that missed expectations and narrowed its full-year operating earnings guidance. In Q3, Constellation posted GAAP earnings per share of $2.97, which missed analyst estimates of $3.05, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, revenue of $6.57 billion exceeded analysts' average estimate of $6.46 billion. Constellation also narrowed its full-year adjusted operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 on either end to a new range of $9.05–$9.45 per share.

Year to date, Constellation Energy's stock is up 57%. Wendy's revenue and same-restaurant sales dipped in the third quarter, but the stock climbed 9% in premarket trading, as the declines weren't as bad as analysts feared. In Q3, Wendy's reported revenue of $549 million, a 3% decline from the same period a year ago but higher than the Street's estimate of $534 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Global same-restaurant sales also dropped by 3.7%, which was not as steep as analysts had anticipated. Earnings per share of $0.24 topped estimates for $0.20 per share. Wendy's international business helped offset declines in US consumer spending, while franchise fees helped bolster revenue. Read more here from Investing.com. Shares in Block ( XYZ ) fell 15% before the bell on Friday after the fintech company, which is owned by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, released earnings on Thursday which caused concern among investors due to Block's payment unit, Square, and its profitability.

The company reported a net loss of $0.31 on $172.3 million in revenue, below expectations for a loss of $0.18 per share on $177.8 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Traffic declined 11.7% year over year, which the company attributed to ""a slowdown in consumer spending within the macroeconomic environment"" and a shift in its loyalty program. Additionally, the fast-casual restaurant chain announced the sale of Spyce, which created the Infinite Kitchen makeline, to Wonder for $186.4 million. Sweetgreen will continue to use Spyce's Infinite Kitchen technology in its kitchens as part of the partnership. Sweetgreen stock fell over 8% in after-hours trading. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street's expectations on Thursday, sending the stock 10% lower in after-hours trading. In the third quarter, Block reported earnings per share of $0.54 on revenue of $6.11 billion. That's compared to estimates of $0.68 per share on revenue of $6.31 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The fintech company, known for its Square point-of-sale systems and Cash App, has increasingly been leaning into crypto and integrating bitcoin transactions into its services. In his shareholder letter, Dorsey said that Square bitcoin, which will enable merchants to accept bitcoin payments, will be rolled out this month. In the third quarter, Square's gross profit rose 9% to $1.01 billion, while Cash App gross profit grew 24% to $1.6 billion. For the full year, Block forecast gross profit of $10.24 billion, assuming year-over-year growth of 15%, which was slightly above its full-year outlook issued last quarter of $10.17 billion. New Opendoor ( OPEN ) CEO Kaz Nejatian outlined a path to profitability on Thursday as the real estate iBuyer seeks to return to profitability. The former Shopify COO, who joined Opendoor in September, laid out three objectives in the company's turnaround: transacting with more sellers, strengthening unit economics, and driving operational efficiency. Nejatian promised adjusted net income would break even by the end of 2026. ""We are refounding Opendoor as a software and AI company,"" Nejatian said. ""In my first month as CEO, we've made a decisive break from the past — returning to the office, eliminating reliance on consultants, and launching over a dozen AI-powered products and features that demonstrate our renewed velocity. Our business will succeed by building technology that makes selling, buying, and owning a home easier and more joyful — not from charging high spreads and hoping the macro saves us.” The strategy was presented along with Opendoor's third quarter results, which missed earnings estimates but beat on revenue. Opendoor reported revenue of $915 million, its lowest quarterly revenue since Q4 2023 but above Wall Street's expectations for $882 million. A loss per share of $0.12 during the quarter was wider than the expected $0.07 loss, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus estimates. For the fourth quarter, Opendoor expects similar declines. The company stated that its adjusted EBITDA loss for Q4 2025 is expected to be in the high-$40 million to mid-$50 million range. Analysts estimated Q4 EBITDA at a loss of $41 million. The stock has been one of the most active tickers this year, as retail investor and meme trade interest has sparked strong moves in the stock. Thursday's post-earnings move was no different, as the stock fell 4% in after-hours trading. Year to date, shares of Opendoor have soared 324%, but the stock is down by 26% in the past month. Airbnb ( ABNB ) stock jumped 5% in extended trading as international bookings buoyed revenue growth in the third quarter. Here's what the vacation rental company reported in its third quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence: In terms of bookings, Airbnb said it saw mid-single digit growth in North America, while bookings grew by mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East, low-20s growth in Latin America (particularly driven by Brazil bookings), and mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific. Overall, Airbnb reported 133.6 million nights and seats booked during the quarter, a 9% increase compared to the same period a year ago. ""During Q3 2025, we saw relatively consistent booking behavior by our guests in terms of market type, travel corridor, and length of stay compared to the same prior-year period,"" the company said in a statement. ""Average lead times were up slightly on a year-over-year basis, particularly in North America in part driven by the launch of our Reserve Now, Pay Later offering."" Listen to Airbnb's earnings call here at 5 p.m. ET. Under Armour ( UAA , UA ) shares sank on Thursday after the athletic apparel retailer swung to a net loss in its second quarter and forecast declining revenue for its fiscal year 2026. For the quarter, Under Armour reported a loss per share of $0.04 on revenue of $1.33 billion. Wall Street analysts were modeling for a loss of $0.02 on revenue of $1.30 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Net sales declined 4.7% year over year, driven by decreases in all categories, which the company attributed to ""ongoing pressure from a challenging consumer demand environment."" Under Armour expects revenue to decline 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. Apparel sales fell 1.1%, due to softness in the run, outdoor, and golf categories. Footwear sales fell 15.7%, and accessories sales dropped 2.8%, compared to the same period in 2024. Gross margin also declined by 250 basis points to 47.3%, ""mainly due to supply chain headwinds, driven by increased tariffs, and a less favorable channel and regional mix,"" the company said. “We don't have a brand problem,"" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank stressed on the company's earnings call. ""And we don't believe we have a product problem. ... But we certainly have a story opportunity. We haven't connected those things. We put a shoe out there like the Assert. We just never told anybody why they should buy it."" Under Armour also announced that Samsonite executive Reza Taleghani will replace 21-year corporate veteran David Bergman as CFO in February 2026. Reuters reports: Read more here. ConocoPhillips ( COP ) stock advanced 0.9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the oil and gas company raised its full-year forecast for production and lowered its outlook for costs. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 beat estimates of $1.41, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Conoco also raised its fourth quarter dividend by 8% to $0.84 per share. The Houston-based company raised its 2025 production guidance to 2.375 MMBOED (millions of barrels of oil equivalent per day), compared to its prior guidance of 2.35 million to 2.37 million barrels of oil per day. ConocoPhillips also lowered its full-year adjusted operating cost to $10.6 billion, compared to prior guidance of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. However, it updated the total project capital for the Willow project, which is an oil drilling site in Alaska, to $8.5 billion to $9 billion. Biotech company Moderna ( MRNA ) posted another net loss in the third quarter as COVID vaccine sales declined; however, the loss was much smaller than analysts expected, and the stock popped 6% in premarket trading. The company reported revenue of $1 billion, a 45% decrease from the $1.9 billion in revenue it reported in Q3 2024. That was primarily driven by a substantial decrease in COVID vaccine sales and other product sales. Moderna reported $971 million in COVID vaccine sales in Q3, with $781 million in US sales and $190 million in international sales. That led to a loss per share of $0.51 for the quarter. However, Wall Street was expecting a much wider loss of $2.18 per share. Moderna has been aggressively cutting costs. Its research and development expenses were down 30% year over year, while the cost of sales decreased 60%. ""We remain highly focused on operational excellence and financial discipline to advance our pipeline and expand the reach of our commercial portfolio,"" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. For the full year, Moderna narrowed its revenue guidance range. It now sees 2025 revenue in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. It previously guided for revenue to be between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion. Reuters reports: Read more here. E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ( ELF ) shares fell more than 21% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company posted a disappointing 2026 full-year outlook. The company expects net sales to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion, below Wall Street's expectations of $1.65 billion, per Bloomberg consensus data. It also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, also far lower than the expected $3.53. It expects net sales growth of approximately 18% to 20%. CFO Mandy Fields attributed the weaker outlook to tariffs, which ""assumes that the 45% tariff rate stays in place for the remainder of our fiscal year."" On a call with investors, she said, ""We estimate every 10 percentage points of incremental tariffs results in a $17 million growth impact to our cost of goods sold on an annualized basis before any mitigating actions."" She added, ""While tariff rates remain volatile, we believe the lead time of our supply chain gives us greater visibility into our costs for the second half of the year."" The stock fell as much as 30% before paring some of those losses. In the company's latest quarter, it posted mixed results. Adjusted earnings beat estimates at $0.68 per share, while revenue came in at $342.9 million, short of Wall Street's expected $365.7 million. Figma saw its shares rise along with its annual revenue forecast, which was boosted by the success of the company's AI tools and design software. Reuters reports: Read more here. Chime Financial ( CHYM ) reported annual revenue growth of 29% in the September quarter, highlighting resilient consumer spending on essentials in the US. The fintech company, which provides digital consumer banking and payment services, including checking and savings accounts, reported revenue of $544 million.

The Houston-based company raised its 2025 production guidance to 2.375 MMBOED (millions of barrels of oil equivalent per day), compared to its prior guidance of 2.35 million to 2.37 million barrels of oil per day. ConocoPhillips also lowered its full-year adjusted operating cost to $10.6 billion, compared to prior guidance of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. However, it updated the total project capital for the Willow project, which is an oil drilling site in Alaska, to $8.5 billion to $9 billion. Biotech company Moderna ( MRNA ) posted another net loss in the third quarter as COVID vaccine sales declined; however, the loss was much smaller than analysts expected, and the stock popped 6% in premarket trading. The company reported revenue of $1 billion, a 45% decrease from the $1.9 billion in revenue it reported in Q3 2024. That was primarily driven by a substantial decrease in COVID vaccine sales and other product sales. Moderna reported $971 million in COVID vaccine sales in Q3, with $781 million in US sales and $190 million in international sales. That led to a loss per share of $0.51 for the quarter. However, Wall Street was expecting a much wider loss of $2.18 per share. Moderna has been aggressively cutting costs. Its research and development expenses were down 30% year over year, while the cost of sales decreased 60%. ""We remain highly focused on operational excellence and financial discipline to advance our pipeline and expand the reach of our commercial portfolio,"" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. For the full year, Moderna narrowed its revenue guidance range. It now sees 2025 revenue in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. It previously guided for revenue to be between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion. Reuters reports: Read more here. E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ( ELF ) shares fell more than 21% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company posted a disappointing 2026 full-year outlook. The company expects net sales to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion, below Wall Street's expectations of $1.65 billion, per Bloomberg consensus data. It also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, also far lower than the expected $3.53. It expects net sales growth of approximately 18% to 20%. CFO Mandy Fields attributed the weaker outlook to tariffs, which ""assumes that the 45% tariff rate stays in place for the remainder of our fiscal year."" On a call with investors, she said, ""We estimate every 10 percentage points of incremental tariffs results in a $17 million growth impact to our cost of goods sold on an annualized basis before any mitigating actions."" She added, ""While tariff rates remain volatile, we believe the lead time of our supply chain gives us greater visibility into our costs for the second half of the year."" The stock fell as much as 30% before paring some of those losses. In the company's latest quarter, it posted mixed results. Adjusted earnings beat estimates at $0.68 per share, while revenue came in at $342.9 million, short of Wall Street's expected $365.7 million. Figma saw its shares rise along with its annual revenue forecast, which was boosted by the success of the company's AI tools and design software. Reuters reports: Read more here. Chime Financial ( CHYM ) reported annual revenue growth of 29% in the September quarter, highlighting resilient consumer spending on essentials in the US. The fintech company, which provides digital consumer banking and payment services, including checking and savings accounts, reported revenue of $544 million.

The bottom line compared favorably with earnings of 81 cents in the prior-year quarter. BAC shares gained 4.9% in early trading in response to the better-than-expected quarterly results. A full day’s trading session will depict a clearer picture. Bank of America recorded an improvement in trading numbers for the 14th straight quarter. Sales and trading revenues, excluding net DVA, grew 8.3% year over year to $5.35 billion. Fixed-income trading fees increased 4.6%, while equity trading income rose 13.7%. We had projected sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) of $5.06 billion. Unlike the previous quarter, the investment banking (IB) performance was robust this time. IB fees (in the Global Banking division) of $1.16 billion increased 47.5% year over year. Equity and debt underwriting income increased 47% and 42.2%, respectively. Advisory revenues grew 52.7%. Improvement in trading and IB fees, along with higher net interest income (NII), drove Bank of America’s total revenues. NII grew on a year-over-year basis on higher interest income related to Global Markets activity, fixed-rate asset repricing and higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. While provisions declined in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, non-interest expenses increased, which hurt the results to some extent. The company’s net income applicable to common shareholders grew 26% from the prior-year quarter to $8.04 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $6.85 billion. Net revenues were $28.09 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.28 billion. Also, the top line increased 10.8% from the prior-year quarter. NII (fully taxable-equivalent basis) grew 9% year over year to $15.39 billion. Our estimate for NII was $15.29 billion. Net interest yield expanded 9 basis points to 2.01%. We expected the metric to be 1.99%. Non-interest income increased 13% from the prior-year quarter to $12.86 billion. This was driven by higher total fees and commissions. We had projected non-interest income of $11.66 billion. Non-interest expenses were $17.34 billion, up 5.2% year over year. The rise was due to an increase in almost all cost components, except for professional fees. Our estimate for non-interest expenses was $17.29 billion. The efficiency ratio was 61.39%, down from 64.64% in the year-ago quarter. A fall in the efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability. Provision for credit losses was $1.30 billion, down 16% from the prior-year quarter. We estimated the metric to be $1.58 billion. Net charge-offs declined 10.9% year over year to $1.37 billion. As of Sept. 30, 2025, non-performing loans and leases as a percentage of total loans were 0.46%, down from 0.53% in the prior-year period. Book value per share as of Sept. 30, 2025, was $37.95 compared with $35.37 a year ago. Tangible book value per share was $28.39, up from $26.25 a year ago. At the end of September 2025, the common equity tier 1 capital ratio (advanced approach) was 13.1% compared with 13.5% as of Sept. 30, 2024. In the reported quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $5.3 billion. Bank of America’s focus on digitizing and expanding operations, decent loan growth and relatively higher interest rates are likely to keep supporting growth. However, elevated expenses and a challenging operating backdrop pose major headwinds.

The bottom line handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.83. JPM’s markets revenues exceeded management's expectations of growth in the high-teens percentage rate. The metric grew 25% year over year to $8.9 billion. Specifically, fixed-income markets’ revenues jumped 21% to $5.6 billion, while equity markets’ numbers increased 33% to $3.3 billion. Also, the IB business performance was far stronger than that expected by management. JPMorgan recorded an increase in NII, driven by higher yields and a 7% year-over-year jump in total loans. Citigroup Inc. C reported third-quarter 2025 adjusted net income per share of $2.24, up 48.3% from the year-ago period. The metric also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.3%. Citigroup’s results benefited from an increase in NII and non-interest revenues, alongside lower provisions. The company also registered a year-over-year increase of 17% in IB revenues, reflecting growth in advisory and equity capital markets. However, increased expenses and a weak capital position were the undermining factors for Citigroup. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

JPMorgan Chase & Co ( NYSE:JPM ) reported a strong net income of $14.4 billion and EPS of $5.07, with a return on tangible common equity (ROTC) of 20%. Revenue increased by 9% year-on-year to $47.1 billion, driven by higher markets revenue and increased fees across asset management, investment banking, and payments. The Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) division reported net income of $5 billion, with revenue up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher net interest income (NII) from increased revolving balances. The Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) division reported net income of $6.9 billion, with revenue up 17% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance in markets, payments, investment banking, and security services. Asset and Wealth Management (AWM) achieved record revenue of $6.1 billion, up 12% year-on-year, with long-term net inflows of $72 billion and assets under management (AUM) increasing by 18% year-on-year. Expenses increased by 8% year-on-year to $24.3 billion, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses. Credit costs were $3.4 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.6 billion, including elevated wholesale charge-offs due to instances of apparent fraud in secured lending facilities. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio decreased by 30 basis points to 14.8%, primarily due to increases in wholesale lending and other market activities. Retail deposit growth was flat this quarter, with expectations for growth rates of 3% and 6% in the future being potentially delayed due to macroeconomic factors. Concerns were raised about potential risks in lending to non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), with specific mention of a $170 million charge-off related to Tricolor. Q : Can you provide an update on the retail deposit growth assumptions for 2026, given the current flat growth? A : Jeremy Barnum, CFO, explained that while the personal savings rate is lower than expected and consumer spending remains robust, the macro environment has shifted slightly. This has pushed out the expected upward inflection point for deposit growth, but the long-term trajectory remains positive, supported by strong net new account growth. Q : What are the key assumptions for the 2026 NII outlook, particularly regarding commercial deposits and loan growth? A : Barnum noted that the outlook uses current forward curves, which include expected rate cuts. The firm remains asset-sensitive, with growth dynamics driven by card revolve growth and deposit balance growth. Wholesale deposit growth is expected to be more muted next year, but the core franchise remains strong. Q : How are you addressing credit fundamentals and demand in the wholesale lending market, especially in light of recent idiosyncratic credit events? A : Barnum highlighted that demand is driven by revived market activity and acquisition finance. The firm maintains a product-agnostic credit strategy across public and private markets, with no significant differentiation in credit fundamentals observed between the two. Q : How are you thinking about reserve builds against the commercial book, given the different portfolio mix compared to prior cycles? A : Barnum stated that the reserve methodology is highly granular and specific. As the portfolio mix shifts, loan growth will come with slightly higher reserve intensity, but this is managed on a situation-by-situation basis. Q : What is your approach to excess capital utilization, and how does it relate to potential dividend hikes? A : Barnum explained that the firm is using its financial resources to lend into the real economy and has aspirations to add significant lending at the margin. While not providing forward guidance on buybacks or dividends, the firm aims to keep excess capital reasonable and deploy it constructively.

Will it sustain?,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> Here are the key points: We are off to a great start in the Q3 earnings season. Not only are most companies easily beating estimates, but the tone and substance of guidance and management commentary are also mostly reassuring and favorable. This should help sustain the positive estimate revisions trend that has been in place in recent months. For the 58 S&P 500 members that have reported Q3 results, total earnings are up +15.4% from the same period last year on +8.0% higher revenue, with 86.2% beating EPS estimates and 79.3% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these 58 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 74.1%. The Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace for these 58 index members represents a notable improvement over what we saw from this same group of companies in the first half of the year. The proportion of these 58 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking significantly above the historical averages for this same group of companies. For the Finance sector, we now have Q3 results from 47.7% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +20.4% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with 96.2% beating EPS estimates and 88.5% beating revenue estimates. American Express AXP became the latest Finance player to beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates, also providing positive and reassuring commentary about the health of the consumer and the broader economy. The American Express results followed similar results and commentary from the likes of JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFC, and others. The economic read-through from these bank results is reassuring and positive, notwithstanding worries about non-bank lenders following a few bankruptcies. Consumer spending and household financials remain stable on the back of a labor market that remains very strong. There are signs of improving credit demand, and delinquencies are off their highs, references to ‘cockroaches’ notwithstanding. Importantly, the capital markets business has finally started showing results, after many quarters of management teams describing improving deal pipelines. We are still at low levels relative to history. But given the favorable regulatory and monetary policy backdrop, it is reasonable to get excited about the sector’s Wall Street business. For the 47.7% of the sector’s market capitalization that have reported Q3 results, total earnings and revenues are up +20.4% and +10.9%, respectively, and 96.2% are beating EPS estimates and 88.5% are beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these Finance sector companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 88.5%. The comparison charts below show the Q3 revenue growth rates and blended beats percentages for these companies. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research For the Zacks Finance sector as a whole, Q3 earnings are expected to increase by +21.3% from the same period last year on +7.6% higher revenues, as the chart below shows. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Positive Q3 results and reassuring management commentary from these banks are helping sustain the favorable revisions trend that has been in place lately. For 2025 Q3, the expectation is for earnings growth of +6.5% on +6.4% revenue gains. We have consistently shown in this space how Q3 estimates have steadily increased since the quarter began. The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q3 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The chart below shows the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The aforementioned favorable revisions trend validates the market’s rebound from the April lows. However, the trend can only be sustained if Q3 earnings results and management guidance for Q4 and beyond confirm it. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its GAAP profit of $5.07 per share was 5.4% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy JPM? Find out in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members). Revenue: $46.43 billion vs analyst estimates of $45.28 billion (7.2% year-on-year growth, 2.5% beat) EPS (GAAP): $5.07 vs analyst estimates of $4.81 (5.4% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $19.44 billion vs analyst estimates of $21.07 billion (41.9% margin, 7.7% miss) Market Capitalization: $822.3 billion JPMorgan Chase delivered third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street’s revenue and earnings expectations, underpinned by robust growth in markets-related revenues and continued strength in consumer banking. Management credited higher asset management and investment banking fees, as well as increased payment activity, for powering revenue expansion. CFO Jeremy Barnum noted, “Revenue was up predominantly driven by higher markets revenue as well as higher fees across asset management, investment banking, and payment.” While credit costs increased, largely due to a few isolated incidents in wholesale lending, overall credit performance in both wholesale and consumer businesses remained in line with expectations. Looking ahead, management’s guidance is shaped by ongoing growth in client account acquisition, evolving deposit trends, and the macroeconomic landscape’s potential impact on consumer and wholesale credit. Barnum pointed out that while the consumer remains resilient, there is increased focus on signs of labor market softening and evolving consumer savings rates. He stated, “We remain quite confident about the overall long-term trajectory here and optimistic, but the macro environment shift has just slightly pushed out some of the growth inflection dynamics.” Management also highlighted that expense discipline and productivity initiatives, including those related to artificial intelligence, will be critical as the company navigates potential headwinds in 2026. Management attributed revenue growth to strong capital markets activity and resilient consumer trends, while margin pressures stemmed from elevated expenses and isolated credit events. Markets revenue surge: Higher activity in fixed income, equity, and securitized products drove capital markets revenue, with notable outperformance in prime brokerage as client activity increased. Consumer banking resilience: The consumer and small business segment continued to show stability, aided by higher revolving balances and new account growth, despite management closely monitoring potential labor market weakness. Asset and wealth management inflows: Record net inflows in asset and wealth management were fueled by strong client demand for both fixed income and equity products, leading to higher management fees and increased assets under management. Wholesale credit normalization: Charge-offs in wholesale lending rose due to isolated events, including a $170 million loss from the Tricolor incident, but management emphasized overall portfolio credit quality remains stable. Expense growth drivers: Expenses increased year over year, reflecting higher volume, revenue-related costs, and continued investment in technology and talent. Management noted that ongoing discipline and productivity efforts, such as leveraging artificial intelligence, are intended to mitigate future expense growth. JPMorgan Chase’s forward outlook is shaped by expectations around sustained client growth, evolving deposit balances, and disciplined expense management amid a shifting macroeconomic environment. Deposit and account growth: Management expects continued net new account openings to support deposit growth, but acknowledges that lower personal savings rates and increased investment flows could delay inflection points in average balances per customer. Credit and economic headwinds: The company is monitoring risks tied to labor market softness and potential deterioration in consumer credit, with Barnum cautioning that “the fact that things are fine now does not mean they are guaranteed to be great forever.” Expense and productivity initiatives: While expense growth is likely due to labor and medical cost inflation, management is prioritizing productivity gains, including those from artificial intelligence, to help offset these pressures and maintain competitive compensation. In future quarters, the StockStory team will focus on (1) trends in deposit growth and consumer spending resilience, (2) normalization in wholesale and consumer credit quality, especially as labor market conditions evolve, and (3) the impact of ongoing expense discipline and AI-driven productivity initiatives on cost growth. Progress in capital markets activity and continued net inflows in asset and wealth management will also be key markers for tracking execution.

The company’s earnings per share of $2.80 surged 49% year over year and easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08. The capital markets business, which encompasses advisory, underwriting and trading operations, had been firing on all cylinders since the start of the third quarter. Hence, Morgan Stanley’s quarterly top-line growth was driven by record investment banking (IB) fees and a strong performance from its trading desk. This, along with robust wealth management, resulted in an 18% year-over-year rise in its net revenues to a record $18.22 billion. The top line also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.4 billion. Morgan Stanley price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Morgan Stanley Quote Global mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the third quarter rebounded solidly from the lows witnessed in April and May following President Donald Trump’s announcement of ‘Liberation Day’ tariff plans. Companies quickly adapted to the rapidly changing geopolitical and macroeconomic scenarios. They took advantage of a strong U.S. economy, optimism over potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and a more accommodating regulatory environment under Trump. So, Morgan Stanley’s IB business gained from a frenzy of deal-making activities and IPOs. Advisory fees jumped 25% year over year to $684 million as completed M&As rose. Further, higher non-investment grade and investment grade issuances supported MS’ fixed income underwriting fees, which surged 39% to $772 million. Additionally, equity underwriting income soared 80% to $652 million “as clients actively engaged in capital-raising opportunities.” Hence, total IB fees (in the Institutional Securities division) increased 44% to $2.11 billion. We had projected it to be $1.54 billion. Morgan Stanley’s solid third-quarter performance echoed across Wall Street, with peers such as JPMorgan JPM and Goldman Sachs GS also booking double-digit increases in IB fees. JPMorgan’s IB business performance was far stronger than expected by management. Total IB fees (in the Commercial & Investment Bank segment) were up 16% from the prior-year quarter to $2.63 billion. The company had projected IB fees to be up in the low double digits. Goldman maintained its leadership in overall fee generation, with IB income of $2.66 billion, climbing 42% year over year in the third quarter. This underscored the company’s dominance in M&A advisory and leveraged finance. Moreover, MS posted a robust trading performance supported by increased client activity and market volatility. Equity trading revenues climbed 35% year over year to $4.12 billion and fixed-income trading income was up 8% to $2.17 billion. Our projections for equity and fixed-income trading revenues were $3.56 billion and $2.11 billion, respectively. Even JPMorgan and Goldman’s trading revenues improved in the third quarter as ambiguity over the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy and changes in the Fed’s policy stance drove client activity. Apart from the capital markets business, Morgan Stanley’s wealth and investment management operations were impressive, driven by a rise in client assets and assets under management. Wealth Management revenues grew 13% to $8.23 billion in the third quarter, by adding new assets and collecting more fees. Likewise, Investment Management posted net revenues of $1.65 billion, jumping 13%. Further, total client assets across both segments reached $8.86 trillion as of Sept. 30, 2025. This brings Morgan Stanley closer to its longstanding goal of $10 trillion in asset management set by former CEO James Gorman. Additionally, Morgan Stanley’s net interest income rose 13% to $2.49 billion. Further, non-interest expenses increased during the quarter. The metric was $12.2 billion, up 10% from the prior-year quarter. Currently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

So far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start. As of Nov. 7, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data , and analysts are expecting a 13.1% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year. Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30. Last week, investors heard from tech and AI players such as Palantir ( PLTR ), AMD ( AMD ), Supermicro ( SMCI ), and Constellation Energy ( CEG ), as well as from Uber ( UBER ), Spotify ( SPOT ), Snap ( SNAP ), and Airbnb ( ABNB ). This week, quarterly results will arrive from The Walt Disney Company, Applied Materials ( AMAT ), CoreWeave, Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ), Rocket Lab ( RKLB ), Oklo ( OKLO ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), and Alibaba ( BABA ), among others. Here are the latest updates from corporate America. For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click here Monday.com ( MNDY ) stock shed 20% in premarket trading after the cloud-based project management software maker issued a softer than expected outlook. For the December quarter, the company expects $329 million in revenue, below the average analyst expectation of $333 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That overshadowed Monday.com's earnings beat, with profits tallying $0.25 per share, versus $0.18 expected. Revenue during the third quarter also came in above expectations, with the company recording $316 million in revenue versus $312 million estimated. The stock was already under pressure. Year to date, shares are off by more than 19% before factoring Monday's premarket losses. Maplebear Inc., doing business as Instacart ( CART ), reported strong top- and bottom-line results as online grocery orders surged in the third quarter. GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 topped Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate of $0.50 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue jumped to $939 million, above estimates of $933 million. Instacart said its orders grew 14% year over year to 83.4 million, driving revenue growth, even as the average order value decreased 4% year over year. Transaction revenue and advertising revenue both grew 10% to $670 million and $269 million, respectively. For the fourth quarter, Instacart expects adjusted EBITDA of $285 million to $295 million, which has a midpoint higher than the Street's estimated $288 million. Instacart stock popped over 8% in premarket trading. The peak portion of the third quarter earnings season is behind us. To recap, investors heard from Robinhood ( HOOD ), Palantir ( PLTR ), AMD ( AMD ), Moderna ( MRNA ), Duolingo ( DUOL ), Snap ( SNAP ), and many others, which you can read more about in the blogs below. In the next week, Disney ( DIS ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), Oklo ( OKLO ), and Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) will highlight the calendar. Although there have been some dramatic drawdowns in individual names so far this earnings season, on the whole, companies have reported more positive earnings surprises than negative ones. FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters has the report card : With 91% of S&P 500 companies having reported third quarter results so far, 82% of companies have reported a positive earnings surprise and 77% of companies have reported a positive revenue surprise. And the earnings growth rate for Q3 now appears on track to increase from the second quarter, at 13.1%. As for the trends this season, some are a continuation from last quarter. Tariffs continue to be top of mind for corporate leaders, and tech enthusiasm centered around artificial intelligence continues to fuel momentum, as my colleague Hamza Shaban alluded to earlier this week. But other cracks have emerged. Several consumer-facing companies have noted that affordability and sentiment pressures are starting to take a toll. And mentions of the government shutdown have spiked, though in many cases just for executives to iterate that they're seeing little to no impact. Constellation Energy ( CEG ) stock fell nearly 6% ahead of the market open after the energy provider reported earnings that missed expectations and narrowed its full-year operating earnings guidance. In Q3, Constellation posted GAAP earnings per share of $2.97, which missed analyst estimates of $3.05, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, revenue of $6.57 billion exceeded analysts' average estimate of $6.46 billion. Constellation also narrowed its full-year adjusted operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 on either end to a new range of $9.05–$9.45 per share. Previously, Constellation had been guiding for operating earnings guidance in a range of $8.90-$9.60 per share. Constellation's nuclear fleet produced 46,477 gigawatt-hours (GWhs) in the third quarter, compared with 45,510 GWhs in Q3 2024, achieving a 96.8% capacity factor, compared with 95.% for the same period a year ago. Year to date, Constellation Energy's stock is up 57%. Wendy's revenue and same-restaurant sales dipped in the third quarter, but the stock climbed 9% in premarket trading, as the declines weren't as bad as analysts feared. In Q3, Wendy's reported revenue of $549 million, a 3% decline from the same period a year ago but higher than the Street's estimate of $534 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Global same-restaurant sales also dropped by 3.7%, which was not as steep as analysts had anticipated. Earnings per share of $0.24 topped estimates for $0.20 per share. Wendy's international business helped offset declines in US consumer spending, while franchise fees helped bolster revenue. Read more here from Investing.com. Shares in Block ( XYZ ) fell 15% before the bell on Friday after the fintech company, which is owned by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, released earnings on Thursday which caused concern among investors due to Block's payment unit, Square, and its profitability. Reuters reports: Read more here. The AP reports Read more here. Sweetgreen ( SG ) missed earnings estimates as fewer consumers ordered salad bowls in the third quarter. The company reported a net loss of $0.31 on $172.3 million in revenue, below expectations for a loss of $0.18 per share on $177.8 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Traffic declined 11.7% year over year, which the company attributed to ""a slowdown in consumer spending within the macroeconomic environment"" and a shift in its loyalty program. Additionally, the fast-casual restaurant chain announced the sale of Spyce, which created the Infinite Kitchen makeline, to Wonder for $186.4 million. Sweetgreen will continue to use Spyce's Infinite Kitchen technology in its kitchens as part of the partnership. Sweetgreen stock fell over 8% in after-hours trading. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street's expectations on Thursday, sending the stock 10% lower in after-hours trading. In the third quarter, Block reported earnings per share of $0.54 on revenue of $6.11 billion. That's compared to estimates of $0.68 per share on revenue of $6.31 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The fintech company, known for its Square point-of-sale systems and Cash App, has increasingly been leaning into crypto and integrating bitcoin transactions into its services. In his shareholder letter, Dorsey said that Square bitcoin, which will enable merchants to accept bitcoin payments, will be rolled out this month. In the third quarter, Square's gross profit rose 9% to $1.01 billion, while Cash App gross profit grew 24% to $1.6 billion. For the full year, Block forecast gross profit of $10.24 billion, assuming year-over-year growth of 15%, which was slightly above its full-year outlook issued last quarter of $10.17 billion. New Opendoor ( OPEN ) CEO Kaz Nejatian outlined a path to profitability on Thursday as the real estate iBuyer seeks to return to profitability. The former Shopify COO, who joined Opendoor in September, laid out three objectives in the company's turnaround: transacting with more sellers, strengthening unit economics, and driving operational efficiency. Nejatian promised adjusted net income would break even by the end of 2026. ""We are refounding Opendoor as a software and AI company,"" Nejatian said. ""In my first month as CEO, we've made a decisive break from the past — returning to the office, eliminating reliance on consultants, and launching over a dozen AI-powered products and features that demonstrate our renewed velocity. Our business will succeed by building technology that makes selling, buying, and owning a home easier and more joyful — not from charging high spreads and hoping the macro saves us.” The strategy was presented along with Opendoor's third quarter results, which missed earnings estimates but beat on revenue. Opendoor reported revenue of $915 million, its lowest quarterly revenue since Q4 2023 but above Wall Street's expectations for $882 million. A loss per share of $0.12 during the quarter was wider than the expected $0.07 loss, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus estimates. For the fourth quarter, Opendoor expects similar declines. The company stated that its adjusted EBITDA loss for Q4 2025 is expected to be in the high-$40 million to mid-$50 million range. Analysts estimated Q4 EBITDA at a loss of $41 million. The stock has been one of the most active tickers this year, as retail investor and meme trade interest has sparked strong moves in the stock. Thursday's post-earnings move was no different, as the stock fell 4% in after-hours trading. Year to date, shares of Opendoor have soared 324%, but the stock is down by 26% in the past month. Airbnb ( ABNB ) stock jumped 5% in extended trading as international bookings buoyed revenue growth in the third quarter. Here's what the vacation rental company reported in its third quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence: In terms of bookings, Airbnb said it saw mid-single digit growth in North America, while bookings grew by mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East, low-20s growth in Latin America (particularly driven by Brazil bookings), and mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific. Overall, Airbnb reported 133.6 million nights and seats booked during the quarter, a 9% increase compared to the same period a year ago. ""During Q3 2025, we saw relatively consistent booking behavior by our guests in terms of market type, travel corridor, and length of stay compared to the same prior-year period,"" the company said in a statement. ""Average lead times were up slightly on a year-over-year basis, particularly in North America in part driven by the launch of our Reserve Now, Pay Later offering."" Listen to Airbnb's earnings call here at 5 p.m. ET. Under Armour ( UAA , UA ) shares sank on Thursday after the athletic apparel retailer swung to a net loss in its second quarter and forecast declining revenue for its fiscal year 2026. For the quarter, Under Armour reported a loss per share of $0.04 on revenue of $1.33 billion. Wall Street analysts were modeling for a loss of $0.02 on revenue of $1.30 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Net sales declined 4.7% year over year, driven by decreases in all categories, which the company attributed to ""ongoing pressure from a challenging consumer demand environment."" Under Armour expects revenue to decline 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. Apparel sales fell 1.1%, due to softness in the run, outdoor, and golf categories. Footwear sales fell 15.7%, and accessories sales dropped 2.8%, compared to the same period in 2024. Gross margin also declined by 250 basis points to 47.3%, ""mainly due to supply chain headwinds, driven by increased tariffs, and a less favorable channel and regional mix,"" the company said. “We don't have a brand problem,"" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank stressed on the company's earnings call. ""And we don't believe we have a product problem. ... But we certainly have a story opportunity. We haven't connected those things. We put a shoe out there like the Assert. We just never told anybody why they should buy it."" Under Armour also announced that Samsonite executive Reza Taleghani will replace 21-year corporate veteran David Bergman as CFO in February 2026. Reuters reports: Read more here. ConocoPhillips ( COP ) stock advanced 0.9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the oil and gas company raised its full-year forecast for production and lowered its outlook for costs. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 beat estimates of $1.41, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Conoco also raised its fourth quarter dividend by 8% to $0.84 per share. The Houston-based company raised its 2025 production guidance to 2.375 MMBOED (millions of barrels of oil equivalent per day), compared to its prior guidance of 2.35 million to 2.37 million barrels of oil per day. ConocoPhillips also lowered its full-year adjusted operating cost to $10.6 billion, compared to prior guidance of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. However, it updated the total project capital for the Willow project, which is an oil drilling site in Alaska, to $8.5 billion to $9 billion. Biotech company Moderna ( MRNA ) posted another net loss in the third quarter as COVID vaccine sales declined; however, the loss was much smaller than analysts expected, and the stock popped 6% in premarket trading. The company reported revenue of $1 billion, a 45% decrease from the $1.9 billion in revenue it reported in Q3 2024. That was primarily driven by a substantial decrease in COVID vaccine sales and other product sales. Moderna reported $971 million in COVID vaccine sales in Q3, with $781 million in US sales and $190 million in international sales. That led to a loss per share of $0.51 for the quarter. However, Wall Street was expecting a much wider loss of $2.18 per share. Moderna has been aggressively cutting costs. Its research and development expenses were down 30% year over year, while the cost of sales decreased 60%. ""We remain highly focused on operational excellence and financial discipline to advance our pipeline and expand the reach of our commercial portfolio,"" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. For the full year, Moderna narrowed its revenue guidance range. It now sees 2025 revenue in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. It previously guided for revenue to be between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion. Reuters reports: Read more here. E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ( ELF ) shares fell more than 21% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company posted a disappointing 2026 full-year outlook. The company expects net sales to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion, below Wall Street's expectations of $1.65 billion, per Bloomberg consensus data. It also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, also far lower than the expected $3.53. It expects net sales growth of approximately 18% to 20%. CFO Mandy Fields attributed the weaker outlook to tariffs, which ""assumes that the 45% tariff rate stays in place for the remainder of our fiscal year."" On a call with investors, she said, ""We estimate every 10 percentage points of incremental tariffs results in a $17 million growth impact to our cost of goods sold on an annualized basis before any mitigating actions."" She added, ""While tariff rates remain volatile, we believe the lead time of our supply chain gives us greater visibility into our costs for the second half of the year."" The stock fell as much as 30% before paring some of those losses. In the company's latest quarter, it posted mixed results. Adjusted earnings beat estimates at $0.68 per share, while revenue came in at $342.9 million, short of Wall Street's expected $365.7 million. Figma saw its shares rise along with its annual revenue forecast, which was boosted by the success of the company's AI tools and design software. Reuters reports: Read more here. Chime Financial ( CHYM ) reported annual revenue growth of 29% in the September quarter, highlighting resilient consumer spending on essentials in the US. The fintech company, which provides digital consumer banking and payment services, including checking and savings accounts, reported revenue of $544 million.

Let us find out.","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS announced third-quarter 2025 results on Oct. 14, before the opening bell. The company’s quarterly top and bottom-line numbers outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The solid improvement in trading revenues and investment banking (IB) business majorly supported Goldman’s performance. Following solid quarterly results, should you buy Goldman’s stock? Before checking that out, let us discuss the company’s quarterly performance in brief. IB Revenues: Driven by higher advisory revenues, signifying a substantial rise in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) volumes, Goldman’s IB revenues jumped 42.5% year over year. Its peers, JPMorgan ’s JPM IB fees rose to $2.6 billion, marking 17.1% year-over-year growth, whereas Morgan Stanley ’s MS IB revenues were $2.1 billion, up 44.1%. David Solomon, chairman and CEO of Goldman, highlighted improvements in M&A throughout the year and expects the constructive environment to persist through the end of 2025, with even stronger M&A activity anticipated in 2026 amid a favorable backdrop. Trading Revenues: The volatile market drove Goldman’s trading volume in the quarter. The company’s equities trading revenues grew 7% year over year to $3.7 billion. Fixed income, currency and commodities trading revenues rose 17% to $3.5 billion. Similarly, JPMorgan’s markets revenues jumped 25% year over year to $8.9 billion. Specifically, fixed-income markets’ revenues rose 21% to $5.6 billion, whereas equity markets’ numbers increased 33% to $3.3 billion. Morgan Stanley’s equity trading revenues climbed 35% year over year to $4.12 billion, and fixed-income trading income was up 8% to $2.17 billion. Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) Division: The AWM division generated revenues of $4.4 billion in the reported quarter, up 17% year over year. The increase reflects increased management and other fees, and significantly higher net revenues in private banking and lending. GS’s IB division continues to build on its momentum in 2025, buoyed by a resurgence in global dealmaking activity. The year began with optimism, though sentiment briefly cooled following Trump’s tariff announcement on “Liberation Day.” Since then, deal flow has accelerated, driving a steady uptrend in Goldman’s IB revenues. Goldman ended the third quarter as the leader in both announced and completed M&A. The company advised on more than $1 trillion in announced M&A volumes year to date. Management indicated that 2026 is expected to be an even stronger year for M&A activity, barring any major macroeconomic shocks. The company’s backlog across IB is now at its highest level in the past three years. Overall, the combination of favorable macro conditions, strong client pipelines and sustained leadership in M&A advisory positions Goldman well to extend its dealmaking dominance. The company’s streamlining effort has been underway for some time as it retreats from the underperforming consumer banking ventures. GS is exiting its non-core consumer banking business and sharpening its focus on Global Banking and Markets, and AWM divisions. The Global Banking and Markets segment has been witnessing a rise in revenues over the past couple of years. The segment's net revenues recorded a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% from 2022 to 2024, with the metric rising 17% year over year in the first nine months of 2025. The AWM division’s net revenues witnessed a CAGR of 9.9% from 2022 to 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, the segment’s net revenues rose 4% year over year. The segment is expanding into fee-based revenue streams. Assets under supervision (AUS) rose to a record $3.5 trillion at the end of the third quarter, with impressive results in private banking and lending. In alternatives, Goldman raised a record $33 billion in the quarter. As a result, the company expects to raise $100 billion in alternatives this year, substantially exceeding its prior full-year fundraising expectations. Goldman is also accelerating growth via innovative partnerships and acquisitions. This month, it agreed to acquire Industry Ventures to expand its exposure to the innovation economy and further solidify its position in the global alternatives market. Last month, Goldman expanded its alliance with T. Rowe Price to give individuals greater access to private markets, with new offerings set to launch in phases. Products for wealthy clients will debut by late 2025, followed by retirement solutions in 2026. GS maintains a fortress balance sheet, with the Tier 1 capital ratios well above regulatory requirements. This financial strength allows it to return capital to shareholders aggressively through buybacks and a healthy dividend yield. As of Sept. 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $169 billion, and near-term borrowings were $73 billion. Given its strong liquidity, the company rewards its shareholders handsomely. Post-clearing the 2025 Fed stress test, the company increased the quarterly dividend 33.3% to $4 per common share. In the past five years, the company has hiked dividends five times, with an annualized growth rate of 22%. Currently, its payout ratio sits at 33% of earnings. JPMorgan raised its dividends six times over the past five years with a payout ratio of 28%. Morgan Stanley has raised its dividends five times over the past five years, with a payout ratio is 42%. Additionally, Goldman has a share repurchase plan in place. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, it had $38.6 billion worth of shares available under authorization. Year to date, shares of Goldman have appreciated 34.6% compared with the industry’s rally of 30.3%. Its peers JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have gained 28.8% and 30.8%, respectively. Price Performance Image Source: Zacks Investment Research In terms of valuation, the GS stock looks inexpensive compared with the industry. The stock is trading at a forward price/earnings (P/E) of 14.42X below the industry average of 14.61X. The stock is also trading at a discount compared with its peers, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, which have forward P/E multiples of 14.64X and 16.88X, respectively. Price-to-Earnings F12M Image Source: Zacks Investment Research GS’s ongoing growth initiatives, consistent capital returns and a steadily improving AWM business provide a strong foundation for long-term financial performance. The rebound in M&A activity and a healthy deal pipeline continue to underpin the firm’s IB momentum, while its robust liquidity profile supports a sustainable and disciplined capital distribution strategy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 18.6% and 12.6%, respectively. Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 earnings has been revised upward. Estimate Revision Trend Image Source: Zacks Investment Research In pursuing growth across business segments, operational efficiency remains central to Goldman’s strategy. During the third-quarter earnings call, management unveiled One Goldman Sachs 3.0 — an AI-driven, centralized operating model aimed at driving efficiency and creating capacity for future expansion. The initiative focuses on six key objectives: enhancing client experience, improving profitability, driving productivity, strengthening scalability and resilience, enriching the employee experience, and bolstering risk management. The company’s recent performance and forward-looking initiatives reaffirm its progress toward achieving its mid-term goals of a 14-16% return on equity (ROE) and a 60% efficiency ratio. Supported by favorable market conditions, operational discipline and strategic execution, GS is well-positioned to sustain growth and deliver long-term value. With its solid fundamentals and improving business mix, Goldman remains an appealing investment choice. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

To be a shareholder in JPMorgan Chase, you have to believe in the firm’s resilience amid digital disruption, regulatory pressure, and rapid innovation. While the recently announced $1.5 trillion Security and Resilience Initiative underscores JPMorgan's focus on future-proofing its business, it does not meaningfully change the immediate catalysts or principal risk, which remain centered on the firm’s ability to defend fee and lending margins from fintech and regulatory headwinds.

Is the stock a buy despite the YTD rally?,"All information and data in this article is solely for informational purposes. For more information please view the Barchart Disclosure Policy here Share Citigroup (C) delivered a stellar performance in Q3 2025 , with both revenues and profits easily beating estimates. Importantly, all five of its business segments posted record revenues in the quarter, and it showed good progress on the transformation plan under CEO Jane Fraser. Citi is outperforming large U.S. banking peers, including J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) , Wells Fargo (WFC) , and Bank of America (BAC) , and is up over 40% for the year. Citi’s outperformance is not just a 2025 thing, and it has risen about 150% over the last two years , which is well ahead of most of its peers. Along with the capital gains, Citi investors are also rewarded with a generous dividend yield of 2.4%, which is higher than many other large banks. In this article, we’ll examine whether Citi is still a good buy, beginning with a snapshot of the company’s Q3 earnings. Banks in general posted a strong set of numbers in Q3. Talking of Citi, America’s third-biggest lender, it posted revenues of $22.1 billion , up 9% year-over-year (YoY) and ahead of the $21.09 billion analysts expected. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 48% over the period to $2.24, while analysts were expecting the metric at $1.90. The company’s net credit losses rose 2% YoY, but total credit costs fell 8% during the period to $2.45 billion. To sum it up, it was a nice quarter for Citi, where it managed to grow its top line and bottom line while keeping delinquencies in check. After Citi’s Q3 earnings, several brokerages raised C stock’s target price, with Morgan Stanley raising its to a Street-high of $134 while maintaining its “Overweight” rating. The firm’s new estimate implies an upside of 35% over the next 12 months. The overall Street sentiment is reasonably bullish on Citi, and of the 24 analysts covering C stock, 12 have a “Strong Buy” rating while four rate the stock as a “Moderate Buy.” The remaining eight analysts rate C as a “Hold” or some equivalent. One of the key pillars of Citi’s transformation is efficient capital allocation. During the Q3 earnings call, Fraser said that “we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders’ capital, investing it where we should and returning what we don’t deploy.” As part of the transformation , Citi has exited several markets, which has freed up capital and bumped up its return metrics. The company’s adjusted return on total capital employed was 9.2% in the first nine months of the year, which is now very close to the medium-term target of between 10% and 11% that the company has set. Fraser reiterated her previous views, terming the target a “waypoint, not a destination,” while adding that ""we see a lot of different areas of upside."" The company has a $20 billion buyback program, and during Q3, it spent $5 billion on share repurchases, which was $1 billion higher than what it guided for. While Citi did not give buyback guidance for the current quarter, CFO Mark Mason hinted that the company would continue prioritizing buybacks. “While we have seen good performance in the stock over the course of the year, we’re still at and around kind of one-times tangible book value, and I think there’s more upside to the stock,” said Mason during the earnings call. Citi has been a play on the transformation and the expected normalization of its valuation multiples . The transformation has progressed nicely, as summed up by Fraser during the Q3 earnings call: “We have been relentless in our execution, and it is creating results. Over two-thirds of our transformation programs are at or are close to our target state and we are making very good progress in the remaining areas.” Meanwhile, Citi’s outperformance has also meant that its valuation gap with peers has narrowed. C stock now trades slightly above the tangible book value of $95.72 that it reported at the end of Q3. However, it still trades below the book value per share of $108.41. I believe the next milestone in Citi’s valuation rerating would be the stock rising to its book value, which is not an unreasonable expectation given where its peers trade. On the dividend front, the company should continue to increase the payouts even as the priority with free cash would be to repurchase shares. Overall, while not a screaming buy as it was when it traded below its tangible book value, Citi is still a decent buy, given the still-low valuations. The dividend yield remains a cherry on top and would only add to the total returns that patient investors make from the stock.",794,en,0.64

These results echoed the same sentiment that we heard from the big banks.","Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> Here are the key points: For the 99 S&P 500 members that have reported Q3 results, total earnings are up +13.7% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 86.9% beating EPS estimates and 81.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these 99 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 75.8%. For the Finance sector, we now have Q3 results from 54.5% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +23.0% from the same period last year on +12.0% higher revenues, with 97.0% beating EPS estimates and 87.9% beating revenue estimates. The Finance sector’s Q3 earnings performance is tracking significantly above what we have seen from the sector in other recent periods, both in terms of the earnings and revenue growth pace as well as the beats percentages. In fact, the sector’s Q3 revenue beats percentage of 87.9% is the highest for this group of companies over the preceding 20-quarter period. The above-average beats percentages at this stage of the Q3 reporting cycle are notable in light of the favorable revisions trend that was in place ahead of the start of this earnings season. In other words, actual Finance sector results came in ahead of expectations that had already moved up before these results came in. American Express AXP became the latest Finance player to beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates, also offering positive, reassuring commentary on the health of the consumer and the broader economy. The American Express results followed similar results and commentary from the likes of JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFC, and others. The economic read-through from these bank results is reassuring and positive, notwithstanding worries about non-bank lenders following a few bankruptcies. Consumer spending and household financials remain stable on the back of a labor market that remains very strong. There are signs of improving credit demand, and delinquencies are off their highs, references to ‘cockroaches’ notwithstanding. Importantly, the capital markets business has finally started showing results, after many quarters of management teams describing improving deal pipelines. We are still at low levels relative to history. But given the favorable regulatory and monetary policy backdrop, it is reasonable to get excited about the sector’s Wall Street business. For the 54.5% of the sector’s market capitalization that have reported Q3 results, total earnings and revenues are up +23.0% and +12.0%, respectively, and 97.0% are beating EPS estimates and 87.9% are beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these Finance sector companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 87.9%. The comparison charts below show the Q3 revenue growth rates and blended beats percentages for these companies. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research For the Zacks Finance sector as a whole, Q3 earnings are expected to increase by +23.4% from the same period last year on +7.8% higher revenues, as the chart below shows. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Earnings Big Picture Positive Q3 results and reassuring management commentary from these banks are helping sustain the favorable revisions trend that has been in place lately. For 2025 Q3, the expectation is for earnings growth of +7.3% on +6.7% revenue gains. We have consistently shown in this space how Q3 estimates have steadily increased since the quarter began. The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q3 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The chart below shows the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The aforementioned favorable revisions trend validates the market’s rebound from the April lows. However, the trend can only be sustained if Q3 earnings results and management guidance for Q4 and beyond confirm it. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This reflects strength in both its markets business and consumer banking operations. See our latest analysis for JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase’s third-quarter earnings arrive alongside a year of headline-making moments, from opening its all-electric skyscraper headquarters in Manhattan to rolling out innovative banking technology and ongoing strategic investments. Despite a recent dip, reflected in a 1.7% one-day share price return and a 5.6% slide over the last month, the longer view shows momentum is very much alive. Shareholders have seen a 23.8% year-to-date share price return and an impressive 35.4% total return over the past year, with even stronger gains over the last three and five years. All told, the market appears to be rewarding JPMorgan’s bold moves and ongoing resilience as it navigates shifting economic currents. If the story of JPMorgan’s expansion has you curious about fresh trends, now’s a perfect moment to broaden your search and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership With all this positive news and long-term investment, the key question for investors becomes clear: does JPMorgan Chase still offer room for upside, or is the market already reflecting all the future growth in its current share price? With JPMorgan Chase recently closing at $297.09, the most widely followed narrative assigns a fair value nearly $24 higher, pointing to more upside potential. The narrative centers on how bold investments in digital banking and transformative technology are shaping the company’s long-term worth. Ongoing investment and active participation in tokenization, stablecoins, and payment innovations (as detailed in the deposit token discussion) positions JPMorgan to benefit competitively from the next wave of technology adoption in banking and payments. This is likely to support both future revenue resilience and margin improvement. Read the complete narrative. Curious what drives such a confident outlook? The answer lies in a mix of ambitious revenue growth forecasts and a profit margin trajectory that keeps analysts betting on premium valuations through the next cycle. Want to unlock what’s fueling that projected price and the catch behind the optimism? The narrative’s key assumptions await discovery. Result: Fair Value of $320.96 (UNDERVALUED) Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts. However, intensifying fintech competition or tighter regulation could quickly challenge JPMorgan’s growth assumptions and put current premium valuations at risk. Find out about the key risks to this JPMorgan Chase narrative. Looking at the price-to-earnings ratio, JPMorgan Chase trades at 14.3x, which is higher than both the US Banks industry average of 11.2x and the peer group at 12.7x. While the share price sits below its estimated fair value, the market is demanding a premium for quality and consistency. The fair ratio suggests a level of 15.6x, which JPM is still below.

A key index tracking US regional bank stocks, the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking ( ^KRX ), rose 1.7% Friday after falling sharply on Thursday by 6% — its worst single-day pullback since the height of the tariff turmoil last April. Investors reacted calmly to a string of new earnings and executive commentary Friday from regional banks across the US, including Truist Financial ( TFC ), Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB ), Huntington Bancshares ( HBAN ), Ally Financial ( ALLY ). Those stocks all rose as loan loss provisions proved to be lower than analysts expected, with the exception of Huntington, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. ""Overall credit quality is strong,"" Truist CEO Bill Rogers said on a conference call. ""We have seen in the market some, I would say, today sort of idiosyncratic and uncorrelated events,"" he noted, adding that his bank is being ""hypervigilant."" Wall Street's credit worries intensified on Thursday after two regional banks, Western Alliance Bancorporation ( WAL ) and Zions Bancorporation ( ZION ), each disclosed some bad loans linked to fraud allegations, sending the stocks of both banks down 10% or more on the day. But both of those stocks recovered on Friday, as did the stock of investment bank Jefferies Financial ( JEF ), a big Wall Street player exposed to the bankruptcy of an auto parts supplier. “I don’t sense any kind of systemic problem in the banking system among the regional banks, I mean, the fundamental business appears to be good,” Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said Friday on Yahoo Finance Live. ""The reality is that even though these exposures may be 'well-contained' and have a 'limited financial impact,' this is an industry where investors — especially those that are new to this sector — tend to 'sell first and ask questions later,' especially when it comes to elevated credit concerns,"" Anthony Elian, an equity analyst covering mid- and small-cap banks for JPMorgan Research, wrote Thursday. That scrutiny traces back to concerns awakened by two recent and sizable bankruptcies in September: subprime auto lender Tricolor and larger auto parts supplier First Brands. Fifth Third, which was one of the earliest US lenders to disclose exposure to the Tricolor bankruptcy, reported a $200 million increase in its net charge-offs on Friday compared to the previous quarter. Read more: What's more important in a bank account: High interest or low fees? That was the same amount of exposure the Cincinnati-based regional bank said it had for an outstanding asset-backed loan it had extended to Tricolor. Another event that may have spooked some investors this week came during JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) earnings day on Tuesday. Its CEO Jamie Dimon issued both a mea culpa and a stark warning when discussing the $170 million loss his bank took from the downfall of Tricolor Holdings, saying it was ""not our finest moment."" ""My antenna goes up when things like that happen,"" Dimon told analysts Tuesday morning. ""I shouldn't say this, but when you see one cockroach, there's probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one,"" he added. Truist CFO Mike Maguire downplayed any larger concerns when speaking to analysts on Friday. ""It would be early to call it an inflection point"" on credit, Maguire said. ""Our performance to date isn't demonstrating that across our portfolios, and we're not seeing that on a broad base,"" he added. Truist Financial reported $436 million in credit provisions and $385 million in net charge-offs. Both credit figures fell when compared to the third quarter of last year and the previous quarter. Maguire said Truist does have exposure to bankrupt auto parts supplier First Brands, but he added that this exposure was reflected in the company's quarterly provisions for credit losses along with the bank's full-year guidance on souring loans. Read more: How to compare personal loan offers: 7 crucial factors besides interest rates ""The exposure is less than $200 million for us, but it would be early for us to get into the details,"" Maguire added. Another regional lender, Webster Financial ( WBS ), reported a provision for credit losses of $44 million versus $46.5 million in the prior quarter and $54 million a year ago. Its net charge-offs were $38.4 million, compared to $36.4 million in the prior quarter and $35.4 million a year ago. ""We haven't been exposed to the headline credits that you've seen,"" Webster Bank CEO John Ciulla told analysts. ""While we remain vigilant, tariffs and labor market uncertainty are not significantly impacting the credit performance of our loan portfolio, and we are not seeing pockets of correlated credit risk emerging,"" Ciulla added. More regional bank CEOs offered similar notes of optimism. ""There'll be some episodic moments and some one-offs, but I think the industry is in good shape,"" Huntington CEO Stephen Steinour said. ""And I'm obviously aware of Jamie's position, comments this week, but I don't see it broadly affecting the industry — and many of those who reported are suggesting the consumer is in relatively good shape,"" he added. ""We certainly are not seeing forward indicators in terms of delinquency or other measures."" Of the country's six largest Wall Street banks that reported third quarter earnings earlier this week, JPMorgan stood out as the only one that increased its amount of credit provisions during the quarter. The country's largest bank added $3.4 billion, a 19% increase compared to last year.

Argus Research director of financial services research Stephen Biggar joins Market Catalysts to take a closer look at the sector as earnings kick off. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts . As you just heard, we were talking about, you know, kind of the economic backdrop, also the stock action, what we've seen from these banks. Did what you hear from them this morning by and large validate your view that the valuations are justified? Yeah, hi Julie. Uh, I think so. Yeah. This was a, you know, certainly a banner quarter for the banks uh so far. We're only one day into the earnings cycle, uh obviously, but the upsides are are pretty considerable. Uh, you know, particularly the capital markets. We expected the lending businesses to be, you know, a little bit weak, uh, kind of this low single digit loan growth. Uh, but but capital markets really, uh, did shine this quarter. And I think that's, you know, part of the justification for uh, the price performance so far is that those rebounding capital markets and it's really across the board. You IPO activity, it's M&A, it's the the trading results, uh, fixed income issuance. Uh, so, you know, there's there's really, uh, no weakness, uh, that that we're finding. And and the conversations from the banks, uh, has been constructive as well. So this is a a spooling effect generally. Uh, you know, good results, uh, tend to portend more good results because the whether it's IPO activity, if a company comes out, goes public and does well, it attracts uh others into it. We think there's a fair amount of pent up demand, uh, for companies to go uh public or even take private. We had we had some of those, uh, like Electronic Arts in the quarter. Uh and you know, keep in mind that the deals, even though M&A deal flow topped a trillion dollars in the third quarter, uh banks don't see that uh revenue right away. It takes a couple of three quarters for those deals to close uh for the transaction to uh take place in order for them to get uh paid for those deals. So, uh so that means, you know, looking out a couple of quarters, uh we would continue to expect that uh revenues will uh still be very healthy.",440,en,0.64

(JPM) Rating Upgrade to Buy,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=187cc7b46e233d1e172e853bdeb386be651081202b681ceb5084225f95db16bd,All You Need to Know About JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Rating Upgrade to Buy,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects. This might drive the stock higher in the near term.","JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for JPMorgan Chase & Co. is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for JPMorgan Chase & Co. imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> . For the fiscal year ending December 2025, this company is expected to earn $20.05 per share, which is unchanged compared with the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for JPMorgan Chase & Co.. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.2%. Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of ""buy"" and ""sell"" ratings for its entire universe of more than 4,000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a ""Strong Buy"" rating and the next 15% get a ""Buy"" rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of JPMorgan Chase & Co. to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

SOFI have skyrocketed 163% over the past six months, vastly outperforming the industry’s 26% gain. Over the past year, the stock has surged 179%, reflecting a wave of investor optimism. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research After such a sharp rally, the key question now is whether SoFi still has room to climb, or if a pullback may be looming. Here’s a closer look at what’s driving the momentum and the outlook ahead. SoFi continues to deliver exceptional user growth, adding a record 850,000 new members in the second quarter of 2025. Total membership has now reached 11.7 million, marking a 34% year-over-year increase. This expanding user base isn’t just growing in numbers but also in engagement. SoFi added 1.3 million new products during the same period, up 34% year over year. 35% of new products were adopted by existing members, highlighting the company’s strong cross-selling capabilities and product diversification. This trend reinforces customer loyalty, enhances lifetime value, and lowers churn risk. In essence, SoFi’s ability to deepen customer relationships while continuously expanding its ecosystem positions it as a long-term winner in the fintech space. SoFi is rapidly shifting toward a capital-light, fee-based model, a transition that investors view positively for its sustainability and scalability. In the second quarter of 2025, fee-based revenue jumped 72% year over year to reach $378 million, driven by origination fees, referral commissions, interchange income and brokerage fees. Annualized fee-based revenue now exceeds $1.5 billion, significantly reducing the company’s dependence on interest income. This evolution not only strengthens SoFi’s margin profile but also mitigates exposure to interest rate volatility and credit risks. SoFi’s profitability metrics are improving as well; its adjusted EBITDA margin hit 29%, up 600 basis points year over year, while the incremental EBITDA margin of 43% underscores disciplined cost control and operational efficiency. Altogether, these developments affirm SoFi’s transformation into a highly scalable and profitable fintech leader. Analysts remain optimistic about SoFi’s earnings trajectory. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects third-quarter 2025 EPS of 8 cents, representing a 60% increase from the prior year. Earnings are expected to grow over 100% in 2025, followed by strong double-digit gains in 2026. Revenue forecasts are equally upbeat, with top-line growth of 28.5% projected for the third quarter and 32% growth for full-year 2025, followed by 23.5% in 2026. These figures highlight SoFi’s accelerating operating momentum and growing confidence in its long-term business fundamentals. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research SoFi may benefit from a first-mover advantage in the U.S. fintech space, but it faces formidable pressure from established banking powerhouses such as JPMorgan JPM and Bank of America BAC. These institutions not only bring decades of customer trust and regulatory experience but are also rapidly expanding their digital capabilities to counter fintech disruptors. JPMorgan has been actively investing in digital banking infrastructure, while Bank of America continues to enhance its mobile and AI-driven services to retain tech-savvy consumers. As SoFi scales, competing with legacy giants like JPMorgan and Bank of America alongside agile fintechs like Revolut, which is now pursuing a U.S. banking license, will remain a defining test of its long-term resilience. SoFi remains a compelling buy backed by its accelerating membership growth, effective product diversification, and a successful pivot toward a fee-based, capital-efficient model. Its growing scale, improving margins and innovative approach give it a distinct advantage in the evolving digital finance landscape. While competition from established banks and fast-moving fintech rivals will remain a challenge, SoFi’s first-mover advantage, expanding ecosystem and operational discipline position it for sustained success. Long-term investors seeking exposure to the future of fintech may find SOFI shares attractive at current levels. SOFI currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After nearly three years of sputtering and false starts since the pandemic-era highs, dealmaking is finally looking like it's back in gear on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley all reported blockbuster third-quarter earnings this week, as CEOs revived mergers and financing plans that had stalled while investors waited for markets to thaw. For the second quarter in a row , signs are mounting that the long-standing dealmaking drought — which has affected bankers' pay and morale — is showing real signs of easing. ""Whether we are entering a golden age of investment banking remains to be seen, but it has been several years of chatter around green shoots, and now the flywheel is taking hold,"" Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told analysts in a call on Wednesday. The firm reported investment banking revenue of $2.1 billion — up 44% year-over-year — buoyed by an 80% surge in equity underwriting to $652 million, as well as rising advisory fees of $684 million, up 25%. Goldman Sachs led the rebound Tuesday, announcing its third-highest quarterly net revenues ever: more than $15 billion, the bank said in its quarterly earnings release. David Solomon , the firm's CEO, told investors in a shareholder call that mergers were back — propelling the firm's advisory revenues 60% higher than the same period one year earlier, to a quarterly total of $1.4 billion. ""The setup remains constructive,"" he said Tuesday, praising a ""more supportive regulatory environment"" for spurring renewed activity. Other firms that reported their numbers this week, from JPMorgan Chase to Bank of America, were also enjoying the dealmaking high, reporting double-digit fee jumps. Stocks of large-cap banks were up late Wednesday morning, with Bank of America up by more than 5%, Morgan Stanley rallying by 6%, and JPMorgan gaining 2%. To be sure, Wall Street knows how it feels to spot rays of optimism, only to see them eclipsed by clouds of uncertainty that disrupt the levers of corporate transacting. ""The world is in an uncertain place, and there could be pauses depending on how geopolitics feel, but generally speaking, the investment banking product category over the next couple of years should be up and to the right,"" Morgan Stanley's Pick predicted. Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan's finance chief, warned in a separate earnings call that Wall Street shouldn't get too comfortable — prospects can change on a dime. ""As you well know,"" Barnum said, ""that could change overnight."" For example, if the government shutdown continues, it could postpone capital markets and public issuance activity, potentially hurting the ECM bankers who take companies public. The volume of deals worth $5 billion or more surged 64% from last year, reaching 100 so far in 2025, up from 61 by this point in 2024, according to LSEG data from September. Over the last few months, banks have advised on the public offerings of Klarna , Figma , and Coreweave . There have also been announcements of mega-deals like the proposed $50 billion Anglo American and Teck Resources merger and Electronic Arts' $55 billion take-private , whose fees are not yet included in the bank's results. At Bank of America, third-quarter investment banking fees reached $2 billion, up 43% compared with last year. More economic certainty around trade, tariffs, and taxes has lifted dealmaking, encouraging clients to make longer-term decisions, chief financial officer Alastair Borthwick said. He said the firm's dealmaking pipeline was up double digits in the third quarter. JPMorgan's investment banking fees rose 16%. Commercial and investment banking net revenues reached nearly $20 billion for the quarter, with CEO Jamie Dimon saying, ""ECM and M&A activity picked up against a supportive backdrop."" ""The quarter showcased the strength of JPMorgan's diversified business model, with all major segments contributing to growth,"" said Kenneth Leon, director of equity research at CFRA Research. ""We think this will lead the momentum for the rest of 2025 and into 2026."" JPMorgan CFO Barnum told shareholders Tuesday that the rebound in lending is ""mirroring the pickup in deal activity across our investment-banking businesses,"" highlighting how client borrowing and transaction volumes are moving in tandem again. ""We're starting to see more M&A activity,"" he added, citing ""the busiest summer we've had in a long time."" The bank said trading and client activity were contributing to a better dealmaking landscape, and executives cited higher compensation and ""growth in front office employees"" — a reversal from the firm's position earlier this year, when Barnum said leadership had told managers to ""resist hiring"" and try to do more with less. Citi's investment bank generated more than $1.1 billion in fees, a 17% increase from the previous year. Corporate lending revenue was up nearly 40% as clients tapped its balance sheet again. The investment banking unit has experienced a surge of ambition driven by its new IB chief, Viswas Raghavan , a former JPMorgan dealmaker who joined Citi last year as executive vice chair and head of banking under CEO Jane Fraser.

Megabank JPMorgan Chase ( JPM +0.28% ) is betting on America. That's the top takeaway from an announcement the company made last week, anyway. The U.S.'s biggest bank measured by assets said it's committing as much as $1.5 trillion to ""facilitate, finance and invest in industries critical to national economic security and resiliency."" Areas where JPMorgan intends to focus its resources unsurprisingly include technology, energy, and manufacturing a wide range of products in pharmaceuticals, robotics, and industrial materials. The question the company's shareholders are asking, of course, is: What does this mean for them? Answer: Quite a bit, actually. There's always been something of a line separating investment capital and the sociotechnical direction in which an entire nation is moving. Sure, corporations often seek to influence political policy, and they certainly capitalize on a nation's economic opportunities to grow. Helping ensure that a society is equipped to deal with near-term and long-term challenges, however, is relatively new. Nevertheless, it's becoming the norm. As JPMorgan Chase's Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon explained in the press release: ""It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing -- all of which are essential for our national security."" He added: ""Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy."" Bottom line? ""America needs more speed and investment."" JPMorgan Chase's commitment to invest as much as $1.5 trillion marks an increase from a previous pledge of $1 trillion. Image source: Getty Images. It won't all be deployed at once. This is a 10-year plan, in fact. The funds aren't simply going toward the purchase of top stocks in the nation's most important industries, either. Indeed, it seems as if the megabank is looking for ways to invest in outfits that aren't exactly big, or even publicly traded. JPMorgan Chase says it ""will make direct equity and venture capital investments of up to $10 billion to help select companies primarily in the United States enhance their growth, spur innovation, and accelerate strategic manufacturing,"" adding that ""the initiative will also include special, thematic research on private companies and supply chain management issues related to rare earths, AI and technology ."" The bank is even hiring all new staff to ensure that this capital is being put to work in the best way possible. But what does it all mean for JPMorgan shareholders, and does it make this stock an even more compelling buy? The news immediately raised several questions. Here are the top four. The press release itself never explicitly said as much, but as was largely expected, at least a big chunk of the $1.5 trillion will come from the company's current and future cash hoard created by profits. As Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said during last week's third-quarter earnings call: We're generating a lot of organic capital. We have a very large excess...an aspiration to add another $0.5 trillion of this type of lending at the margin, that's the type of RWA [real world asset] growth that consumes excess. And obviously, in the context of the excess, $10 billion of direct equity investments that are incremental is a nice deployment of a modest portion of the excess. For perspective, JPMorgan Chase earned about $44 billion in net income through the first three quarters of this year, but boasts nearly $4.6 trillion in assets. There's nothing especially unusual about a bank investing a portion of its otherwise-idle money, by the way, even if it is required to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity to cover customer deposits and the like. This effort also suggests that JPMorgan Chase intends to connect opportunities with third-party capital, via private and public fundraising. Kudos to JPMorgan Chase and Dimon for being pro-American. Make no mistake, though -- this isn't charity work. Dimon made it very clear during a conference call to discuss the security and resiliency initiative that ""This is not philanthropy. This is 100% commercial."" As pro-America as the plan may be, President Donald Trump isn't involved. Dimon and the program's other overseers have been piecing together the idea for months now. Indeed, in 2023, Dimon wrote that the U.S.'s supply chains of critical products and materials ""must be domestic or only open to completely friendly allies or partners."" This is simply follow-through (with significant embellishment) on that concern. The only government involvement will be discussions with regulators to figure out ways to ""remove obstacles that stand in the way."" The press release specifically mentioned ""excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need"" as roadblocks that need to be addressed. There was a time when the entire investment industry was content to let businesses and industries do their thing, and then simply let investors decide which were the most promising, risk-adjusted prospects for their capital. Not anymore, though. The world's become too complicated to assume that companies and industries will grow into what investors hope for, or even expect, them to become. Investors are increasingly looking to become involved earlier in an opportunity's existence, giving them the right to help shape and steer an organization or industry. In many cases, this may well deter a privately held company from ever going public . It's arguably the right/best direction for the investing intermediary business. As the stock market itself becomes more volatile and less rewarding, capitalism is indeed likely to ease its way toward more privatization and more holistic oversight like the plan that JPMorgan Chase is putting in place now. The overarching question remains, of course: Does this 10-year, $1.5 trillion investment plan make JPMorgan Chase stock more of a buy that it wasn't before? The vast majority of investors already saw it as a strong buy. The shares recently fell -- although not by much -- from a record high following a near-200% run-up from their 2022 low. Bullish interest was never in question. But, yes, the initiative does make JPMorgan Chase shares an even more compelling investment prospect than they were just a few days ago. It's admittedly a bit unusual to see any bank take such a strong, specific interest in the direction a particular country's competitiveness is or isn't moving in. Rather, for most of their history, banks have simply been responsive service providers for whatever the environment was at the time. The economic and investing environment of 2025, however, is arguably different than it's been in the past. Take technology, for instance, particularly now that artificial intelligence tools are in the mainstream, and always at your fingertips. The world is incredibly noisy, digitally speaking, overwhelming... well, everyone. Investors aren't immune, creating volatility that causes the stock market itself to be difficult to navigate. There's also no denying that too few huge companies now make up too much of the overall stock market's total value, while too many small publicly traded outfits aren't actually worth owning. It's the private up-and-comers that offer the real opportunity, but they're difficult to find, let alone invest in . Owning a stake in JPMorgan Chase is an efficient way of indirectly owning these promising start-up enterprises. So, yes -- JPMorgan Chase stock is an even better buy than it was a little more than a week ago. Its Security and Resiliency Initiative is the sort of proactive effort that all companies need to make in an environment where every aspect of an investment should be well-managed from its very inception. That's all Jamie Dimon is really trying to do. Given his and JPMorgan's track record, this forward-thinking effort is likely to pay off nicely for shareholders. Invest better with The Motley Fool.

We will be closely watching for confirmation of the positive revisions trend that has been in place ahead of the start of this earnings season. Unlike the typical revisions behavior in the post-Covid period, Q3 estimates went up since the quarter got underway, with key sectors like Tech, Finance and Energy enjoying positive estimate revisions. In terms of the Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 49 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 49 index members are up +16.5% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 83.7% beating EPS estimates and 81.6% beating revenue estimates. This is better performance from these S&P 500 members relative to what we have seen from this group of companies in other recent periods, particularly on the revenue side. It is still early in the Q3 reporting cycle, but there is clearly momentum on the revenue side from what we have seen already. We will need positive guidance and management commentary to help sustain the favorable revisions trend that has been in place in recent months. An improving earnings outlook will help validate the market’s solid gains this year. To that end, we have made a very reassuring start to the earnings season.

At the same time, they emphasized that geopolitical uncertainty requires vigilance to ensure the good times last. With a frothy stock market boosting dealmaking, corporate lending and returns on asset management and trading, banks ranging from JPMorganChase ( JPM ) to Wells Fargo ( WFC ) topped consensus projections while expanding profits from the same period a year ago. In a research report, UBS noted the results from big banks were ""not what the bears wanted."" Indeed, most investors praised them, sending shares of the major banks sharply higher in recent sessions. The financial results of large banks provide important clues on consumer credit trends, the performance of capital markets and the health of the economy overall. Investors are keeping close tabs on banks' earnings reports and comments from their top executives amid uncertainty about the economic outlook and increased market volatility. Amid the ongoing federal government shutdown and global trade tension, though, some bank executives cautioned against complacency. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO, said third-quarter results reflect a resilient U.S. economy. But a murky outlook persists. ""There continues be a heightened degree of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation,"" Dimon said. ""As always, we hope for the best, but these complex forces reinforce why we prepare the firm for a wide range of scenarios."" JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, saw its third-quarter earnings rise 12% despite flat net-interest income , even as loans and deposits increased. The company's investment-banking unit helped drive the profit gain, with its revenue up 14%. At Goldman Sachs ( GS ), profits surged 39% as investment-banking fees rose a whopping 42%. Yet the company reportedly plans to move ahead with more than 1,000 layoffs by the end of the year, with CEO David Solomon noting ""conditions can change quickly,"" requiring strong risk management. ""Longer term, we are prioritizing the need to operate more efficiently,"" Solomon said. At Wells Fargo, net interest income exceeded expectations, and the bank unveiled a higher net interest margin target. Charlie Scharf, the bank's CEO, said the company's overall 9% profit gain reflected ongoing momentum across its businesses. ""Spending on debit and credit cards continued to increase, auto loan originations had strong growth from a year ago and total client assets in our wealth and investment management businesses continue to grow,"" Scharf said, adding that ""the financial health of our clients and customers remains strong."" Net earnings at Morgan Stanley ( MS ), meanwhile, soared 45%, driven by record-high, third-quarter revenue. Equity trading revenue and investment-banking revenue grew 35% and 44%, respectively, accounting for about a third of the firm's business. JPMorganChase.

But in addition to the banks, there will be reports from key industries such as the rails, asset management, semiconductors and energy. We know business is strong in the AI Revolution stocks, but what about those outside of it? All 5 of these companies beat on earnings last quarter. Four out of the 5 companies have outstanding earnings surprise track records though. Two of them have only missed once in the last 5 years. It’s not easy to beat every quarter, or almost every quarter, for 5 years. It takes great management that communicates well with the analysts. Everyone has to get on the same page. Will these companies beat again this quarter? And what do they see with the economy, the consumer and their businesses? 1. CSX Corp. ( CSX ) CSX is the first of the railroads to report earnings. It beat on earnings last quarter but had missed three quarters in a row prior to that. Earnings of CSX are expected to decline 9.3% this year. CSX isn’t cheap. It trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.4. A P/E under 15 indicates a value stock. Will CSX make it two in a row? 2.The Charles Schwab Corp. ( SCHW ) Schwab has a great earnings surprise track record. It has beat on earnings 10 quarters in a row. Shares of Schwab are trading near 5-year highs. Earnings are expected to jump 43% in 2025. Schwab still has an attractive valuation with a forward P/E of 19.8. While not a value stock, it’s also not trading as high as the S&P 500, which is around 23x. Will Schwab make it 11 beats in a row this week? 3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ( TSM ) Taiwan Semiconductor is an earnings all-star. It has only missed one time in the last 5 years and that miss may fall off the chart as it was all the way back at the end of 2020. Exactly 5 years ago. Earnings of Taiwan Semi are expected to soar 38.8% this year. Taiwan Semi has a forward P/E of 28.7. That’s not cheap but it’s not as stretched as some semiconductor stocks. Will Taiwan Semiconductor beat again? 4. Bank OZK ( OZK ) Bank OZK is a regional bank headquartered in Arkansas with a market cap of $5.6 billion. It’s known as a real estate bank, as it provides construction loans for commercial and residential developments, including condo and apartment buildings. Bank OZK has an excellent earnings surprise record. It has beat 8 quarters in a row. The shares are cheap. Bank OZK has a forward P/E of 7.7. A P/E under 10 is considered to be dirt cheap. It also pays a dividend, yielding 3.6%. Should investors make a bet on the regional banks like Bank OZK this quarter? 5. SLB ( SLB ) SLB is a large cap oilfield services company. It has only missed on earnings one time in the last 5 years. But that miss was just 2 quarters ago. Shares of SLB are down 15.8% year-to-date. It’s cheap. SLB trades with a forward P/E of just 11. But earnings are expected to fall 15.5% this year. Is SLB a value or a trap? Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI . Here is a synopsis of all four stocks: The momentum investing theory of buy high and sell higher is starting to look plausible for JPMorgan Chase stock as the bank leader currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and lands the Bull of the Day. Illustrating its ongoing dominance and leadership in the banking industry, JPMorgan was able to continue its impressive streak of surpassing quarterly expectations last Tuesday. More applaudable, JPMorgan has taken center stage regarding strategic investments that align with national security priorities and has positioned itself as a key player in shaping the future of the American economy through technology. Trading just under $300 a share, JPM is up over +20% this year, but does offer a 6% discount from its 52-week high of $318, which it hit in late September. Assisting the U.S. Government in a plan to ramp up domestic production of rare earth minerals that are critical for defense and tech industries, JPMorgan has launched a ""Security and Resilience Initiative"" in which it will deploy $1.5 trillion in financing over the next decade to support America's strategic manufacturing, technological innovation, and infrastructure. Notably, this will include $10 billion in direct equity and venture capital investments in U.S.-based companies. This comes as China has long dominated the rare earth supply chain and has recently exercised tighter export restrictions for these essential commodities as part of its tariff retaliation against the U.S. Strengthening its relationships with policymakers and regulators, JPMorgan stands to benefit by enhancing its long-term lending portfolio in high-growth markets that are likely to receive more government support and public interest. Regarding its short-term outlook, fiscal 2025 and FY26 earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher since JPMorgan's Q3 report. Seeing strength in investment banking, JPMorgan's trading revenue hit a record in Q3, boosting its top line 9% to $46.42 billion compared to $42.65 billion in the prior year quarter. Even better, net income reached $14.4 billion or $5.07 per share, a 16% increase from EPS of $4.37 in Q3 2024. JPMorgan has now surpassed sales estimates for seven straight quarters and has exceeded earnings expectations for 13 consecutive quarters. Over the last four quarters, JPM has had an average sales and earnings surprise of 3.81% and 11.01% respectively. Attributing to its strong buy rating is that FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates for JPM are up nearly 1% in the last seven days. In the last month, FY25 and FY26 EPS revisions have risen over 2% and are up more than 4% over the last quarter. JPMorgan's annual earnings are now expected to be up over 1% this year and projected to rise another 4% in FY26 to $20.90 per share. Outside of JPMorgan's operational efficiency, there have been strong indicators of efficient capital deployment, including a 17% ROE with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) hitting 20%. Indicative of a bank's financial strength and stability, JPMorgan's standardized and advanced Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios are currently above 14%. It's noteworthy that JPM posted the highest CET1 mark among the 22 largest U.S. banks in the Federal Reserve's 2025 stress test at 12.5%. Supportive of the in-depth details as to why JPM stock looks hot right now, the cherry on top is that the rising EPS revisions have magnified its reasonable forward P/E valuation of 15X. Plus, JPM is offering a generous 1.98% annual dividend of $1.50 per share, after increasing its yield by 20% so far this year. In addition to its strong buy rating, JPM stands out with an ""A"" Zacks Style Scores grade for Momentum. Short-sellers along with speculative traders looking to profit from a short squeeze may be watching 1-800-Flowers stock, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The specialty e-commerce provider has seen its stock plummet more than 40% in 2025 and has re-entered penny stock status at around $5 a share. Unfortunately, those on the short squeeze side may be early as FLWS could be headed lower given 1-800 Flowers' diminishing outlook despite being known for its online niche in floral products and gifts. Reflecting pessimism for 1-800 Flowers stock, the short interest in FLWS is above 50% as more than half of publicly traded shares are being borrowed and sold by investors who expect the stock price to decline. Free-falling from a 52-week high of $9 a share, the technical analysis for FLWS reflects a very bearish outlook with limited short-term support levels. To that point, the 50-Day simple moving average (Green Line) for FLWS has been bearishly below its 200-Day SMA (Red Line) since Q3 of last year, with both support levels currently under $6 a share. As a brief synopsis, specialty retail headwinds have added to 1-800 Flowers' deteriorating financial metrics. Opening the door to increased competition from large e-commerce giants, a more inflation-conscious consumer has sought out flower and gift offerings from Amazon, Walmart and Costco. On top of this, an abundance of direct floral competitors have continued to emerge, including Teleflora, ProFlowers, and UrbanStems, among others. Facing substantial drops in both revenue and profit margins, 1-800 Flowers hasn't been profitable since its fiscal year 2022, posting a net loss of $200 million or -$0.82 per share in its most recent FY25. Hopes of positive EPS in FY26 or FY27 have also subsided as revisions are down over the last 60 days to projections of -$0.62 and -$0.18, respectively. This paints the picture as to why FLWS could float lower with there being no meaningful top-line expansion to give the benefit of the doubt to a company that has been public since 1999. Not to prolong the conversation of a clear downtrend in FLWS, but what makes the compressed top and bottom line figures more concerning is that 1-800 Flowers appears to be in a cash crunch. Reporting negative free cash flow in the last twelve months (-$68 million), it's noteworthy that 1-800 Flowers now has less than $50 million in cash & equivalents with more than $130 million in long-term debt. Investors who are looking at 1-800 Flowers' ""cheap"" stock price as a bargain may want to think again. While FLWS could eventually be a candidate for a short squeeze, it may keep falling for now as 1-800 Flowers doesn't appear to be in a position to cover short-term debt obligations without liquidating assets or seeking additional financing. Correlating with such, 1-800 Flowers has undergone a leadership change and is reevaluating its strategy to adapt to shifting consumer expectations and competitive pressures. Palantir Technologies Inc. and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. are both capitalizing on the growing artificial intelligence (AI) software solution market, with both stocks gaining more than 300% in the past year. Therefore, let's see how one should allocate funds between Palantir and BigBear.ai to maximize returns while minimizing risks. Palantir's CEO, Alex Karp, must be over the moon after the company posted a stellar second-quarter performance. Palantir's revenues in the U.S. business increased 68% year over year, with commercial and government revenues growing 93% and 53%, respectively, according to investors.palantir.com. Even more impressive was Palantir's ability to secure 157 deals in the second quarter, each worth at least $1 million, with 66 deals valued at a minimum of $5 million. Additionally, the total contract value closed at a record $2.27 billion, representing a 140% year-over-year increase. This suggests that Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has gained significant popularity in commercial and government sectors. Furthermore, Palantir is optimistic about increasing business from existing clients and expects net income to improve throughout the year. The company has also raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $4.142-$4.150 billion, with third-quarter revenues projected between $1.083 and $1.087 billion. Unlike Palantir, BigBear.ai's second-quarter performance was disappointing. This is primarily due to a sharp decline in revenues, as its products failed to make an impression on the U.S. government, including the Army. Revenues for the quarter totaled $32.5 million, down 18% from $39.8 million in the same period last year, according to ir.bigbear.ai. BigBear.ai's revenue growth has been weakening for several quarters, and now management expects full-year revenues to be between $125 million and $140 million, down from the prior forecast of $160 million to $180 million. This revision was mainly due to delays in contract approvals by the U.S. government. BigBear.ai had a backlog of $380 million as of June 30, 2025. However, only 4% of this sizable backlog is secured and authorized, per SEC filings. Most contracts are with the U.S. government, which could lead to lengthy and complicated approval processes. Finally, BigBear.ai incurred losses in the second quarter due to increased research and development expenses and low gross margins. The company reported a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $8.5 million, significantly higher than the $3.7 million loss a year earlier. Perceptive investors may choose to invest heavily in Palantir stock, given its strong growth prospects. Palantir's management has raised both revenue and income forecasts, driven by increasing demand for its AIP platform. Moreover, Palantir's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 103.27, far above the Internet - Software industry's 6.28. This high valuation suggests that investors have high expectations for Palantir's future growth. However, the same cannot be said for BigBear.ai stock. Unlike Palantir, BigBear.ai is struggling to build a strong customer base, while its dependency on government contracts hinders growth. Its business remains unprofitable, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of its business model. But its recent partnership with the U.S. Navy and deployment of its advanced passenger processing solution at the Nashville International Airport and an expanding AI software platform market may improve its prospects in the near future. As a result, investors may allocate a small portion of their portfolio to BigBear.ai stock. For now, both Palantir and BigBear.ai stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

JPM, Commvault Systems, Inc. CVLT and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp. WAB. To determine earnings, subtract production costs from revenues. Consistent earnings growth is essential for all companies since survival depends on profitability. Earnings are also regarded as the most important factor influencing share prices. However, expectations of earnings play a significant role. Nonetheless, stocks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Commvault Systems, Inc . and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp. are currently showing excellent earnings growth. We have frequently seen a decline in stock prices despite earnings growth, followed by a rally in prices after an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations. Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess a firm's cash flow to determine its fair value. Thus, investors should be on the lookout for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates. The above criteria narrowed the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 16. Here are the top three stocks: JPMorgan JPMorgan is a global financial services company involved in consumer banking, investment banking and asset management.

(Bloomberg) -- The consortium buying Electronic Arts Inc. is set to add more than a dozen banks to its underwriting group after JPMorgan Chase & Co. put up $20 billion of debt to bankroll the leveraged buyout. Most Read from Bloomberg Affordable Housing Left Vulnerable After Trump Fires Building Inspectors Los Angeles County Declares State of Emergency Over ICE Raids There’s a Better Way to Win on Traffic Safety Trump Floats San Francisco as Next Target for Crime Crackdown NY Senator Behind Casino Push Urges Swift Awarding of Licenses The deal, orchestrated by the buyers of the video-game maker — private equity firm Silver Lake Management, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners — would shift some risk off of JPMorgan by bringing other financial firms into the fold. A number of banks have signed non-disclosure agreements and have been through credit committees, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Some banks will take around 10% of the deal each, or about $2 billion apiece, while others will take less, the people said. Around 15 banks are likely to join the underwriting group, some as early as next week. JPMorgan will keep around 40% of the deal, the people said. Underwriters are expected to earn a fee of about 2.25% on the loans in the financing, some of the people said. Fees for bonds will be higher than those of loans, they added. JPMorgan, EA and Silver Lake declined to comment. PIF and Affinity didn’t respond to requests for comment. Banks have been vying for a slice of the roughly $500 million of fees tied to the financing. JPMorgan was the sole debt underwriter for the $55 billion acquisition, which is the largest commitment ever by one bank for a LBO. A buyout of this size is a major test of the banking industry’s capacity to orchestrate and allocate vast amounts of capital on a global scale. Once the underwriting group is in place, the banks plan to sell the debt in the leveraged loan and high-yield bond markets in early 2026, according to the people. The cross-border, dual-currency financing is structured with a $2.5 billion term loan A that will target investors looking to buy loans on a take-and-hold basis, the people said. That could attract attention from Middle Eastern and Asian banks, they said. The financing is also set to comprise an $8 billion term loan B, $2.5 billion of unsecured bonds, $5 billion of secured bonds and a $2 billion liquidity facility, the people said. Still, the final structure of the transaction will depend on market conditions at the time of the launch, they added.

GS reported double-digit growth in its investment banking (IB) revenues in the third quarter of 2025. Global mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the quarter were impressive, rebounding from the lows witnessed in April and May following President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs. Nonetheless, deal-making activities have picked up pace since then as corporates adapted to the rapidly evolving geopolitical and macroeconomic scenarios. They took advantage of a strong U.S. economy, optimism over potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and a more accommodating regulatory environment under Trump. Driven by higher advisory revenues, signifying a substantial rise in M&A volumes, GS’s IB fee revenues totaled $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2025, up 42.5% from the prior-year quarter. Specifically, advisory revenues surged 60% year over year, while debt underwriting revenues moved up 30% and equity underwriting revenues grew 21%. Additionally, Goldman ended the third quarter as the leader in both announced and completed M&A, having advised on more than $1 trillion in announced M&A volumes year to date. During the third-quarter earnings call, David Solomon, chairman and CEO of Goldman, highlighted improvements in M&A activity throughout the year and expects the constructive environment to persist through the end of 2025, with even stronger M&A activity anticipated in 2026 amid a favorable backdrop. Overall, the combination of favorable macro conditions, strong client pipelines, and GS's sustained leadership in the M&A advisory will continue to support its IB performance in the upcoming period. Similar to Goldman, its peers Morgan Stanley MS and JPMorgan JPM witnessed solid growth in their IB revenues in the third quarter. Riding on a frenzy of deal-making activities and IPOs, Morgan Stanley's IB revenues were $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025, up 44.1% from the prior-year quarter. Its fixed income underwriting fees rallied 39%, while equity underwriting income surged 80% year over year. Morgan Stanley’s advisory fees jumped 25% year over year to $684 million as completed M&As rose. During the third-quarter earnings call, Ted Pick, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley, said that the rebound in the operating environment enabled M&A and renewed financing activity. While he remained cautious, remarking that “whether we are entering a golden age of investment banking remains to be seen,” he affirmed that IB activity should trend upward over the next couple of years. JPMorgan’s IB fees stood at $2.6 billion in the third quarter, implying 17.1% year-over-year growth. Specifically, JPM’s advisory fees rose 9%, with debt and equity underwriting fees growing 53% and 9%, respectively. During the third-quarter earnings call, Jeremy Barnum, executive VP and chief financial officer of JPMorgan, noted healthy deal flow with robust pipelines, supported by a constructive market environment. GS shares have gained 34.6% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 28.7%. Price Performance Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, Goldman trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.33X, below the industry’s average of 14.38X. Price-to-Earnings F12M Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Goldman’s 2025 and 2026 earnings implies a year-over-year rise of 19.6% and 12.4%, respectively. Likewise, the consensus estimate for the company’s 2025 and 2026 sales implies year-over-year rallies of 9.1% and 5.9%, respectively. Earnings estimates for both years have been revised upward over the past seven days. Estimate Revision Trend Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Goldman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Publicly-traded BDCs are drawing new scrutiny amid new concerns about private credit. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors.,"Morningstar analyzed the myth of the “stock-picker’s market” and whether there is evidence of consistent manager outperformance. Publicly-traded BDCs are drawing scrutiny amid new concerns about private credit. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. October 21, 2025 The Myth of the Stock-Picker’s Market “[T]here’s overwhelming evidence that most active managers don’t add enough value to cover their costs, even in market environments that should be more favorable for stock-picking. It’s also worth pointing out that it’s impossible to predict when the market climate might turn out to be more conducive to active management.” ( Morningstar ) JP Morgan Readies New Managed Accounts Platform “The wrap-fee advisory platform is called J.P. Morgan Managed Services, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated Oct. 9. It will offer access to managed portfolios through J.P. Morgan and third-party investment managers and is open to all program accounts, including those opened with J.P. Morgan Private Client Advisors or its financial advisor unit.” ( FundFire ) BDCs, Private Credit’s Most Popular Funds, Are Drawing Scrutiny “BDC stocks have dropped to multi-year lows in recent days, while spreads on the bonds the vehicles — issued to boost their investing firepower — have widened, in some cases to the highest levels since April’s global tariff turmoil.” ( Bloomberg ) Beyond the Buzz: What ETF Share Classes Mean for Mutual Funds “So far, most of the analysis touches on the opportunity for mutual fund firms while cautioning about the operational challenges to be met to offer a fund with both mutual fund and ETF shares. But recent history suggests that there may be another outcome for many mutual fund companies that have not yet embraced offering ETFs.” ( ETF.com ) Breathe Through Your Mouth “All-in, the swap financing costs accounted for 6.40% to 8.60% of the fund’s average daily net assets over its lifetime, with the price tag rising as time went on. If we focused just on the spread component, the annual cost ranged from 3.00% to over 4.10% of the ETF’s average daily net assets. Taken together with the ETF’s 0.95% expense ratio, the spread costs alone would push the annual fee close to 5% per year based on the most recently-reported swap financing terms.” ( Basis Pointing ) Private Credit Projected to Anchor $119B in Alternative Flows by 2026 “While the year-over-year growth moderates slightly to around 6%, this forecast underscores the sector’s meteoric rise, having expanded nearly 17-fold in fundraising between 2020 and 2026. Together, total alternative fundraising across asset classes is forecast to grow approximately 17.7% between 2025 and 2026, from $192 billion to $226 billion.” ( AltsWire ) Carrot or Stick? Managers Dial Up Efforts to Boost Staff AI Use “Asset managers are stepping up efforts to get employees to use artificial intelligence tools, with some tracking usage, meeting with holdouts, and including AI use in performance reviews.” ( FundFire ) GOP Bill Would Codify Trump Private Equity 401(k) Order “A Montana Republican lawmaker announced Tuesday the introduction of a bill that would codify President Donald Trump's executive order that aims to make it easier for retirement plans to invest in private markets.” ( Law360 ) There Are Now More PE Funds Than McDonald’s Franchises. What’s Behind the Alts Explosion? “PE and venture capital assets now account for roughly 12% of investments in the US, a meteoric rise from their meager beginnings in the 1990s. To meet demand, asset managers are coming up with new products that are blending traditional portfolios with platform models, sometimes including alternatives alongside publicly traded assets.” ( The Daily Upside* ) Private Capital Chases Deals in the Booming Wealth Management Sector “Defying the broader market’s somewhat bleaker M&A outlook, the deal boom for wealth-focused registered investment advisors highlights an upsurge in the sheer wealth and number of high-net-worth investors, who are worth an estimated $140 trillion in global private assets.” ( Morningstar ) Related: AUM Thresholds, Limited Track Records Dampen B/D Appetites for New ETFs David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com , including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

See our latest analysis for DigitalBridge Group. DigitalBridge Group’s share price surged earlier this week as excitement grew around JPMorgan’s big bet on sectors where DigitalBridge is actively building, including AI and edge computing. Even after a double-digit jump over the past seven days, the stock’s 1-year total shareholder return remains in negative territory. This reflects previous volatility but also hints at renewed investor momentum. If fast-moving tech trends and infrastructure shifts have you thinking bigger, now’s a perfect time to discover See the full list for free. With shares now up double digits in just a week but still trading well below analyst targets, is DigitalBridge Group genuinely undervalued at today’s prices or has the recent rally already priced in what comes next? At $12.32, DigitalBridge Group’s share price sits well below the narrative’s fair value estimate of $16.5, suggesting room for upside if bullish analyst assumptions hold true. Here is what is fueling the optimism behind this rally. The explosion in AI workloads and hyperscale/cloud CapEx is driving unprecedented demand for data centers and power, fueling a substantial multi-year leasing and development pipeline for DigitalBridge; this supports long-term revenue, FEEUM, and EBITDA growth as the company monetizes these trends through new asset deployment and leasing.

The narrative hinges on extraordinary growth targets and margin transformation, not your average infrastructure forecast. See what numbers are convincing analysts the upside is so compelling. Result: Fair Value of $16.5 (UNDERVALUED) Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts. However, persistent competition and tightening credit markets could disrupt DigitalBridge's growth trajectory. These factors may potentially challenge the optimistic long-term forecasts driving today's rally. Find out about the key risks to this DigitalBridge Group narrative. While analyst narratives see significant upside, the SWS DCF model tells a very different story. According to our DCF analysis, DigitalBridge is trading well above its intrinsic value of $5.56. This suggests the market may be pricing in more optimism than fundamentals currently support. Is the momentum getting ahead of itself, or is the model too conservative?

Buy the Surge in First Solar Stock Before It's Too Late? The excitement for First Solar’s massive earnings potential is back in effect, with the solar industry leader being boosted by a powerful mix of policy support, analyst upgrades, and strong business fundamentals. Being a prime beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Act, which has an emphasis on incentivizing and investing in clean energy and climate initiatives, more long-term visibility demand is on the horizon amid increased government funding for renewable energy. This comes as First Solar’s U.S. production facilities are reportedly sold out through 2028, with the company specializing in cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar modules that offer superior performance compared to traditional silicon panels. As a reminder that the all-time high for First Solar stock is over $300 a share, FSLR has spiked +10% so far this month and is now up nearly +40% year to date. Recently hitting a fresh 52-week peak of $248, this certainly begs the question of whether it's time to buy the surge in FSLR before it gets more expensive or if there will still be better buying opportunities ahead. FSLR Reports On October 30 Propelling FSLR is that First Solar is expected to post strong Q3 results on Thursday, October 30. Zacks' projections call for First Solar’s Q3 sales to be up an eye-popping 74% to $1.54 billion compared to $887.67 million in the prior year quarter. Taking advantage of this impressive top line expansion, First Solar’s earnings are expected to climb 46% to $4.24 per share versus EPS of $2.91 in Q3 2024. FSLR Technical Analysis With investors being lured by foreseeable expectations of high double-digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2025 and FY26, FSLR has been on a tear since breaking out above its 50-day and 200-day SMAs in July. Previously, at the end of last year, the drop in First Solar’s 50-day SMA (green line) below the 200-day SMA (red line) led to an extended downtrend in FSLR before the reemergence of several catalysts, including the clarification of what ended up being favorable policy changes regarding updated rules for clean energy tax credits and federal incentives. First Solar’s 50-day and 200-day SMA support levels are currently at roughly $169 and $210 a share, respectively. First Solar’s Attractive P/E Valuation At current levels, FSLR still trades at a reasonable 16X forward earnings multiple despite such an extensive rally in recent months. From a historical perspective, First Solar stock not only offers a nice discount to the benchmark S&P 500 and many of its solar peers but also trades more than 20% from its decade-long median of 21X, with an extreme high of over 1,500X during this period. FSLR Price Target & Analyst Upgrades Blowing past its current Average Zacks Price Target of $231.17, several analysts have recently upgraded their price targets for First Solar stock to over $260. This includes analysts at BMO Capital , Jefferies Financial Group and JPMorgan , with Citigroup currently having the street high price target of $300. What the Zacks Rank Suggests Most influential to Zacks' proprietary ranking system is the trend of earnings estimate revisions (EPS), with FSLR currently landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the last quarter, EPS revisions for First Solar are still positive but have dipped in the last week for FY25 and FY26. Conclusion & Final Thoughts Although it’s very enticing to chase the rally, the technical analysis of FSLR also shows how this stock can be very volatile and influenced by these trading indicators. It’s understandable how FOMO could be setting in, but the possibility of better buying opportunities is not off the table, even with new emerging catalysts such as the use of solar energy to support AI infrastructure.

DigitalBridge Group Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) is one of the best performers on Tuesday. DigitalBridge extended its gains for a second day on Tuesday, jumping 15.71 percent to finish at $13.48 apiece, supported by announcements from JPMorgan that it would invest $10 billion in companies deemed critical to the United States’ economic security and resiliency. DigitalBridge Group Inc. (NYSE:DBRG)—a global digital infrastructure company—is expected to indirectly benefit from the supposed investments, with JPMorgan signaling plans to pour funds into firms engaged in the business of artificial intelligence and edge computing—among the industries that the former is directly invested in. The said amount forms part of JPMorgan’s larger $1.5 trillion investment plan over the next 10 years in a bid to support economic security and resiliency. Apart from edge infrastructures and data centers, DigitalBridge Group Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) also invests in towers, fiber, small cells, managed services, and real estate companies. Based on its historical reporting dates, DigitalBridge Group Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) is scheduled to release the results of its third-quarter financial and operating performance on November 3, 2025.

Bank of America posted net income of $8.47 billion while Morgan Stanley reported $4.6 billion. Both figures were more than $1 billion higher than what analysts saw coming. A big reason for that performance is a frenzy of mergers and IPOs that surged through the summer.

Fees from Bank of America’s client trading divisions rose 8% to $5.3 billion while Morgan Stanley’s soared 24%, driven by its stock transactions group.

Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick called his bank’s quarter “outstanding” in an earnings statement. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan noted ""strong fee performance from our market-facing businesses.” The results reinforce what is shaping up to be a robust third quarter for big US banks with sizable Wall Street operations. Bank of America took the highest-paid investment banking role in Union Pacific's ( UNP ) agreement to purchase Norfolk Southern ( NSC ) for $71 billion, which was announced in July. This mega-combination of two major US railroad operators was the single largest deal so far this year. Morgan Stanley also advised on that deal. It also co-facilitated the Keurig Dr Pepper ( KDP ) $18 billion acquisition of JDE Peet's ( JDEP.AS ). Bank of America’s stock rose 4% in early trading following the release of its results. Morgan Stanley's stock climbed more than 6%. Their rivals, Goldman Sachs ( GS ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Citigroup ( C ), and Wells Fargo ( WFC) , shared their quarterly results a day earlier. They, too, all reported a rise in profits, dealmaking, and trading that outperformed Wall Street’s expectations.

Citigroup's increased 17% to $1.17 billion, and Wells Fargo's dealmaking fees rose 25% to $840 million. These lenders are all benefiting from a speedier merger approval process from the Trump administration, and they also stand to gain from a loosening of capital and supervisory requirements promised by Trump's Washington regulators. Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick told analysts later Wednesday that in the current moment for major investment banks ""macro uncertainty and enormous opportunity uncomfortably coexist"" and that the entire ""daisy chain"" of financing needs in such a environment ""probably takes us back to something that feels like the mid 90s."" Even Main Street lending showed some improvements during the third quarter. Bank of America's core lending margin, net interest income, jumped 9% to $15.38 billion compared to the third quarter of last year. That set a new high for the bank’s quarterly lending revenue, breaking the previous record set last quarter. Other big banks with sizable Main Street operations — Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo — also posted higher net interest income compared to the third quarter of the previous year.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Rigetti Computing, Inc.'s RGTI, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL . Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: To say there's a lot of hype around AI is the understatement of the decade. It's been at the headlines of this rally, helping create new fortunes and fuel the next generation of bellwethers. These names have already made some epic runs. If only there was a way to play the surge in a more sustainable way. Maybe...a company that helps to power all these chips and such. Today's Bull of the Day is one of those names. Enter Advanced Energy Industries , the unsung hero of the silicon supply chain, sitting squarely at the intersection of physics, precision, and profitability. It's not a chipmaker. It's not an equipment behemoth like Applied Materials. AEIS is the one building the finely tuned, high-precision power systems that make every wafer fab hum like a Swiss watch. When it comes to semiconductor manufacturing, AEIS is the quiet voice that says, ""You want clean power? You want consistency down to the electron? We got you."" Let's get into why this stock, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the most intriguing mid-cap semiconductor plays on the board right now. Every chip, whether it's in your iPhone, your Tesla, or your AI data center, starts life in a fabrication plant that's part physics lab, part cleanroom cathedral. These fabs depend on incredibly stable and precise power delivery systems to etch, deposit, and measure at the atomic level. That's AEIS's playground. The company designs and manufactures high-performance power conversion, measurement, and control solutions for advanced semiconductor and industrial applications. Think plasma power for etching and deposition, high-voltage power for inspection, and thermal control for all the processes in between. If you've ever wondered how a fab keeps the electricity steady enough to carve a transistor only a few atoms thick, AEIS is the answer. That's why Applied Materials, Lam Research and Tokyo Electron are among its biggest customers. They build the gear. AEIS gives that gear its pulse. If you're wondering why AEIS is in such a sweet spot, it's because everything semiconductors touch is expanding. AI data centers? They need more wafers. EVs? More power electronics. Renewable energy? More advanced inverters and control systems. And the global fab buildout, led by the U.S., South Korea, and Taiwan, is a multi-year infrastructure boom that plays right into AEIS's hands. Semiconductor capital equipment spending in 2025 is projected to rebound by double digits after a soft 2024, and AEIS's management has already signaled that demand from leading-edge nodes (sub-5 nanometer processes) is beginning to recover. The company's broad exposure means it benefits not only from memory and logic production but also from advanced packaging and inspection. These are areas less cyclical than pure front-end chipmaking. Now, the beauty of AEIS isn't just in the technology, it's in the trajectory . The company's last few quarters have shown the kind of disciplined execution you love to see in a cyclical sector. Margins are expanding, backlog visibility is improving, and analysts have been steadily revising earnings to the upside. There is a lot cooking under the hood with this company. Current year Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for $5.68 with is good for 53% growth year-over-year. That's slated to grow another 15% to $6.54 next year. Onto the revenue side of the equation, current year forecasts call for 16.7% growth to $1.73 billion with next year adding another 6.76% to $1.85 billion. According to its last earnings report, gross margins are hovering near 38%, with management targeting the low 40s by 2026 through better product mix and cost discipline. AEIS doesn't chase wild, unprofitable growth. It engineers steady, sustainable profitability. It's never fun when a market darling falls out of favor, especially one that used to print money faster than the Fed during COVID. But that's exactly what's happening with today's Bear of the Day, Paycom Software . This once high-flying HR tech stock has been grounded by slowing growth, margin pressure, and increased competition in the payroll software space. If this were an episode of Shark Tank , Kevin O'Leary would be telling them to ""take it behind the barn and shoot it."" Paycom has long been a favorite among investors who loved its high-margin, recurring-revenue model and sticky customer base. The company provides human capital management (HCM) solutions all in one integrated cloud platform. For years, it rode the SaaS wave higher, turning HR drudgery into a scalable subscription machine. But lately, that machine's been sputtering. Revenue growth, once clipping along above 25%, has decelerated sharply. Last quarter, Paycom reported just low-teens top-line growth, missing Wall Street's expectations. Analysts have since trimmed their forward estimates and those estimate cuts are precisely what push stocks into Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) territory. A big part of what makes the Zacks Rank system powerful is that it tracks analyst estimate revisions. Unfortunately, the revisions here are unmistakably bearish. Over the last 60 days, several analysts have slashed their EPS forecasts for both this year and next. The current consensus for fiscal 2025 earnings now sits well below where it was just two months ago. Margins, once north of 40%, have come under pressure as the company spends heavily to retain clients and fend off growing competition from the likes of Paylocity, ADP, and Workday. Meanwhile, a sluggish hiring environment means fewer paychecks to process, which means fewer dollars flowing through Paycom's system. Here's the irony: Paycom's biggest threat might be itself. The company rolled out ""Betty,"" its automated payroll platform, designed to revolutionize how HR departments run payroll by eliminating manual input. The problem? Many of Paycom's existing customers are transitioning to Betty, which actually reduces their usage fees. The innovation cannibalized the cash cow. When your best new product makes your old one obsolete, Wall Street doesn't cheer, it runs for cover. Analysts have been quick to notice that Betty's rollout, while strategically sound for the long term, is crushing near-term growth. Once upon a time, investors were happy to pay sky-high multiples for hypergrowth names like PAYC. Now, that multiple compression is brutal. The stock's forward P/E has fallen from the 70s down to the low 20s, and that's assuming the estimates stop dropping. If earnings get revised down again, those ""cheap"" multiples could suddenly look expensive. Paycom Software is learning the hard way that in a maturing SaaS landscape, growth without leverage doesn't get rewarded anymore. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) tells the story clearly. Analysts are moving in the wrong direction, expectations are sliding, and sentiment has soured. Sure, long-term investors might argue Paycom's sticky customer base and best-in-class tech will eventually stabilize results. Maybe. But for now, with estimate revisions heading south and the stock trading below key support, this looks more like a ""sell the bounce"" situation than a ""buy the dip."" Additional content: Rigetti Computing, Inc. 's shares have gained more than 2,800% in the past year as investors showed excitement over its quantum breakthroughs. However, Rigetti's weak fundamentals and lofty valuation raised doubts about its future growth trajectory and how investors should position themselves toward the stock. Let's see in detail – Rigetti's shares have soared over the past year as the company secured major contracts and made significant progress in advanced quantum computing technology. Rigetti's 36-qubit quantum system achieved 99.5% accuracy in key operations, marking a breakthrough toward developing a 100+ qubit chiplet-based system by the year's end. Rigetti signed a $5.8 million deal with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to further develop quantum networking technology. It also received orders for two 9-qubit Novera quantum computing systems worth nearly $5.7 million, scheduled for delivery next year. Additionally, capital is pouring into the quantum computing sector, benefiting dedicated companies like Rigetti. JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced plans to invest about $10 billion in various innovative fields, including quantum computing. This has driven the stocks of quantum computing companies, including Rigetti, higher. Ongoing contracts and continuous breakthroughs in quantum computing may give Rigetti's stock the momentum needed to keep climbing. However, quantum computing remains in its early stages, and companies in this field require substantial funding for research and development. Rigetti recently completed a $350 million equity offering, providing the company with enough cash to continue operations and easing concerns about funding stability. Rigetti's business model also offers a competitive edge over rivals and positions it for growth once quantum technology becomes mainstream. The company has its own quantum processing units (QPUs), programming language and the Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) platform. Yet, it remains uncertain whether Rigetti can sustain its current explosive growth. The company's fundamentals do not fully support its soaring valuation. Rigetti's operating losses increased 24% year over year to $19.8 million in the second quarter, while revenues fell 42% to $1.8 million, citing investors.rigetti.com. Furthermore, Rigetti faces stiff competition from larger players like Alphabet Inc. , making it a potential takeover target. Additionally, Rigetti's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an astronomical 1,348.30, compared with the Internet - Software industry's 6.28. This indicates the stock is vulnerable to a broader market correction. Overall, RGTI stock shows signs of being a bubble that could eventually burst. Risk-averse investors should steer clear of the stock, as it remains a speculative investment. Risk-takers may choose to capitalize on the potential growth opportunities. Currently, Rigetti has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here . Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The decision by the New York-based bank, which had separated its CEO and board chair positions for close to 20 years, is a major signal of support for 58-year-old Fraser — and the final consolidation of her power as boss over the $1.8 trillion megabank. The move to consolidate both roles to a single person, which Citi hasn't done since before the 2007 mortgage meltdown, also follows a broader trend across the industry in recent years to give CEOs board control. Many of the country's other largest lenders have CEOs who also lead their bank's corporate board, including JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Bank of America ( BAC ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ), Morgan Stanley ( MS ), and Goldman Sachs ( GS ). “Citi is in a fundamentally different place than it was when these roles were separated,” Citi director John Dugan, who will become lead independent director of the board after serving as chair since 2019, said in a statement. “Jane’s very deliberate plan to make Citi a simpler and more focused bank has created meaningful shareholder value.” Citi’s stock was down slightly on Thursday morning. Since the beginning of the year, its shares have climbed 36%, outperforming all rivals. “As we get more and more of the hard yards behind us, my excitement about what’s possible for Citi grows exponentially,” Fraser said in a statement. At the turn of the millennium, Citigroup was the country’s largest financial institution that billed itself as a ""financial supermarket,"" offering any and all services needed by consumers, businesses, and governments. In the decades since that time, the colossus proved too complex and unwieldy to manage effectively. It was dealt a major blow to its sweeping ambitions in the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The company has since been on a multiyear journey to slowly unwind parts of that empire. Since becoming CEO in 2021, Fraser has been trying to put her own stamp on the bank by shrinking and simplifying it into five streamlined core business divisions. Over Fraser’s five-year tenure, Citi’s stock is up 46%. Based on its vesting restrictions, Fraser’s new bonus also gives her more reason to remain as the bank’s chief through the end of the decade. To make good on its recovery promise, the bank has pointed to surpassing a key threshold for bank profitability known as return on tangible common equity (ROTCE). After bumping the threshold down earlier this year, it's aiming for a ROTCE of 10% to 11% for next year, below its previous range of 11% to 12%. Its ROTCE was 8% as of the end of September. Along with boosting its profitability, two related and crucial actions Fraser has set out for the bank are spinning out its Mexican consumer bank, Banamex, via an IPO and removing a 2020 consent order imposed by regulators regarding data integrity within its compliance and regulatory reporting requirements. The company said in September that it reached an agreement to sell a 25% equity stake in the Mexican consumer unit to an entity owned by billionaire financier Fernando Chico Pardo, marking a step in its divestment plans. However, not every Citi watcher is thrilled by how the board of directors handled Fraser’s power consolidation. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo, who has championed Citigroup’s stock as his No. 1 pick this year, called the bonus award an example of “subpar governance” that continues the bank’s “long tradition of paying in excess,” in a Thursday morning note to clients. The outcome of Fraser’s efforts “have still not delivered results that are desired by shareholders,” given that Citi hasn’t yet hit its profitability target yet and its consent order from the Federal Reserve is still in place, Mayo wrote.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, roiled markets recently when he commented that he was worried about “cockroaches.” While Mr. Dimon likely isn’t suffering from an insect outbreak, his comments pointed to the bankruptcy of auto parts company First Brands. Dimon warned that there were likely more firms like First Brand, commenting that “when you see one cockroach,” you’re likely to encounter more. He added that there might be some “excess” in the credit market, given its bull run since 2010. Cramer also discussed JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s Sapphire cards and their advertisements, as well as the “cockroach” comment: “[On race among credit card issuers to cater to high income high earners with perks] I’m watching these Sapphire ads and I said, this must be an ad for Temu or Shein.

(Revised),"Bank ETFs like IYG, IYF, KBWB, XLF and VFH dip on credit jitters. Are gains ahead as Q3 earnings & a steepening yield curve offer hope?","Interest rates are on the decline, U.S.-China trade tensions have heightened and markets have been on a wild ride of late. Against this backdrop, the largest banks of the United States reported earnings. The economic signal from these bank results remains positive so far despite concerns over non-bank lenders, especially after a few recent bankruptcies. Wall Street credit concerns have resurfaced lately, following a warning from JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon about “cockroaches” in the U.S. economy, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Note that on Thursday, shares of regional banking shares suffered due to fresh signs of credit stress in the banking sector. Zions Bancorporation plunged 13% on the day and Western Alliance Bancorporation fell about 10%. Zions took a $50 million charge-off related to two loans extended through its California Bank & Trust division, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Meanwhile, Western Alliance said it filed a fraud lawsuit in August against a borrower tied to a revolving credit facility. However, Western Alliance has assessed the collateral and believes that their value is sufficient to cover the obligation. Vanguard Financials Index Fund ETF VFH has lost 3.1% over the past month (as of Oct. 21, 2025) while SPDR S&P Bank ETF KBE has fallen 5.2%. These returns came against 0.7% uptick in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY. The capital markets segment is finally delivering results after several quarters of management highlighting improving deal pipelines. While activity has remained low by historical standards, the favorable regulatory and monetary policy environment makes it reasonable to be optimistic about the sector’s prospects. Consumer spending and household finances remain stable, supported by a decent labor market. Credit demand shows signs of improvement and delinquencies have declined from their peaks despite references to so-called ‘cockroaches.’ For the Finance sector, we now have third-quarter results from 47.7% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies grew more than 20.4% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues, with 96.2% beating EPS estimates and 88.5% beating revenue estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo & Company WFC, Citigroup Inc. C, Goldman Sachs GS, Morgan Stanley MS and Bank of America BAC beat both top and bottom-line estimates in their latest earnings releases. The Finance sector ranks fifth out of the 16 Zacks classified sectors. The Financial - Investment Bank category, which most big banks come from, is also strongly positioned at present. The industry ranks in the top 14% of the 243 industries classified by Zacks. The financials sector currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 10.97X versus 19.88X possessed by the S&P 500. The Financial - Investment Bank industry trades at a forward P/E of 15.61X. Projected EPS Growth of the sector is a solid 8.41% versus the S&P 500’s growth of 6.88%. The Financial - Investment Bank industry’s growth is 14.45%. The financials sector currently has a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.34X than the S&P 500’s 0.58X. The Financial - Investment Bank industry’s debt-to-equity ratio is even lower at 0.15X. The Fed is currently cutting interest rates. If risk-on sentiment in the market holds (assuming the so-called AI bubble doesn’t burst), long-term bond yields are likely to rise, while short-term yields will decline due to the Fed’s rate cuts. This would steepen the yield curve — a positive for the banking sector — by boosting banks’ net interest margins. However, healthy credit demand is necessary to support gains in the net interest margins. Against this backdrop, financials exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF IYG, iShares US Financials ETF IYF, Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB, Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF and Vanguard Financials ETF VFH, should gain ahead.

Jamie Dimon Delivers A Harsh Statement","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning about hidden financial risks as signs of deeper cracks begin to emerge in the credit markets. Dimon cited recent bankruptcies like Tricolor and First Brands as potential signals of broader instability, likening the situation to seeing “one cockroach” and knowing there are more. Among Dimon’s concerns are over-leveraged subprime borrowers, particularly in auto loans and credit cards, where asset values no longer match outstanding debt. Dimon’s statement is again another example of why some experts are comparing the present moment to the 2008 financial crisis, recalling how early failures at Bear Stearns were dismissed before the full collapse. Douglas McIntyre: So Jamie Dimon, the king of all global bankers, head of JP Morgan Chase, had some harsh words for people when it comes risk. You want to pass some of that on? Lee Jackson: Well, and I don’t think that Jamie Dimon’s the Lone Ranger. I think, you know these, these bankruptcies, you know, there was two that were, were significant. First there was our friends, Tricolor, which were kind of, they were like lending to the lowest, you know, the kind of sub submarket credit guys for, for lending and First Brands, which was a company that had acquired tons of other auto parts distributors that, you know, smaller O’Reilly’s or you know, those kind of guys. And they just kept adding, adding debt, adding debt, and then it just blew up and there was money that couldn’t be found and things of that nature. And Jamie Dimon, you know, he’s been around, he, he, he’s, he’s seen this, this play before, you know, he saw it, you know, in, in no uncertain circumstances in 2007 and ‘08, he saw it in 2000, and God knows he saw it when long-term Capital blew up because that was a very dicey situation that could have gone either way. And, you know, his comment, which I think is good as that is that, “If you see one cockroach, there’s usually more.” And you know, and then everybody comes out and says, oh, the credit markets are fine. And, uh, regional banks are fine and everything’s copacetic and all that. But the thing is, I was sitting on a trade desk at a hedge fund in 2007, and then we saw the news on TV, Bear Stearns to close two of their, you know, CMO mortgage funds. We looked at each other, looked back at the tv, looked at each other, and we went, uh oh. Uh oh, ’cause those are all CMOs. They’re stacked up on them. And, and they bailed out in the summer of 2007. But everybody then was saying the same thing. Why is this happening? But everybody had seen a wild mortgage market for like four years, and I remember Barney Frank going, there is no mortgage problem. There’s none. Well, you know, it took a full year after the collapse of those Bear Stearns funds and I knew people there ’cause I worked there and not at that time obvious. But, you know, we all looked at each other, you know, on the trade desk there and we’re like, “Wait a minute…” And these were big funds, so what if Jamie Dimon’s, right? What if there is more First Brands and more Tricolor, and there’s regional bank failures like we saw at Silicon Valley Bank, and what if this is the tip of the iceberg? Because, you know, this has gone on pretty unabated for the last four years plus. McIntyre: The economy faces two default risks. The first one is, is that for what you and I used to call junk bonds, the Michael Milliken invention, they still exist. So it’s been easier for them to borrow in a lot of ways. It’s easier to borrow at 8% than it is at 15. The other thing is, is you now have these subprime who’ve gotten great credit card deals, they’ve gotten 0%, 72 month financing on their cars. The value of their car loans is worth way, way more than the cars themselves. Jackson: Absolutely. McIntyre: It’s a domino effect. You know, you start to see lots of subprime car people because the economy slows, lots of defaults there. Lots of defaults in areas about what we’ve been talking about now. Jackson: You’re right. You’re exactly right. McIntyre: Then you get shotgun size holes blown in pieces of the economy that nobody expected to be there. I mean, it’s like the old saying, well, I didn’t loan anybody money on the supposition they wouldn’t pay me back, you know? Well, guess what? Jackson: Well, you know, I think that people and Dimon, I think is, is not just talking about defaults that have happened recently. I think he’s looking big picture, you know, and he’s basically, your Capitalist Democrat, for lack of a better term, you know, he’s pretty much leaned that way. But, you know, he’s a real centrist smart guy. And if they, the Democrats were smart, they’d maybe consider running him for president. I don’t think he would take it, but I think he’s worried about a more systemic, you know, failure and spread through the economy for all the reasons you just mentioned, and kind of pull the rug out from the positives in the economy, which for the most part has been, you know, stronger this year than, certainly than Wall Street expected and the GDP higher than Wall Street expected. But boy, if we start to go into a bunch of defaults and credit spreads get real tight. I don’t know. I think we, we’ve had a long run and, you know, you and I have been in this business for a long time and there, there’s always something out there, you know, like Roseanne Roseannadanna used to say on Saturday Night Live, it’s always something and it is always something, especially in the credit markets. McIntyre: What will kill it first, a collapse in the equity market or a collapse in the credit market. Jackson: Well, and Bessant was literally saying, you know, we’re gonna continue with our plan even if the stock market crashes, or you know, he said that recently. So, which was a veiled threat to everybody. It’s like, okay, you know, if we’re gonna continue, even if the stock, you know, we’re not gonna bail you out. And you know, the president tends to use kind of a shotgun approach. And so when he said raise the terms on, on China to a 100-150%, well boom. That’s why we had the huge sell off last Friday. And it’ll be interesting to see because there’s a lot of, there’s a lot on the margin and at the scale size it’s big because, because the, if we, I’ll tell you one thing though. If we can solve the China problem and the China trade problem, we may see a big continuation of this rally. McIntyre: If the anxiety about a trade war with China disappears, if there’s some settlement, even if it’s not incredibly favorable, it’s just. You’ve put the cows down for the night, you don’t have to worry about stampedes. I think the market gets a very positive benefit even out of a mediocre trade deal with China. Jackson: Yeah, I agree. And, you know, Besson’s smart because he, you know, and everybody that’s even a dime story economist knows this. China depends far more on our economy to strengthen theirs that we do on, on theirs to strengthen ours. I mean, they have to have the ability to, you know, sell products into the United States. And so, I think you’re right. Even a tacitly nice agreement would set for smooth sailing and then they can get the rest of these tariffs at whatever level they’re gonna be settled out, and then things can settle down a little bit. But I mean, the stock market’s had a huge run. We’re, we’re fixing to start the – there’s the Mississippi and Southern in me – we’re fixing to start the fourth year of what’s been a pretty strong bull market. McIntyre: You will see a deal with China within two weeks. Okay? It’s the 17 th , so as we move into November, I’m predicting that they will have a relatively comprehensive trade deal.",1398,en,0.24

Are gains ahead as Q3 earnings & a steepening yield curve offer hope?","Interest rates are on the decline, U.S.-China trade tensions have heightened and markets have been on a wild ride of late. Against this backdrop, the largest banks of the United States reported earnings. The economic signal from these bank results remains positive so far despite concerns over non-bank lenders, especially after a few recent bankruptcies. Wall Street credit concerns have resurfaced lately, following a warning from JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon about “cockroaches” in the U.S. economy, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Note that on Thursday, shares of regional banking shares suffered due to fresh signs of credit stress in the banking sector. Zions Bancorporation plunged 13% on the day and Western Alliance Bancorporation fell nearly 10% after both disclosed losses tied to troubled business loans (read: ETFs to Gain Amid Latest U.S. Regional Banking Worries). Vanguard Financials Index Fund ETF VFH has lost 4.5% over the past month, while SPDR S&P Bank ETF KBE has fallen 9%. These returns came against a 0.1% uptick in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY. The capital markets segment is finally delivering results after several quarters of management highlighting improving deal pipelines. While activity has remained low by historical standards, the favorable regulatory and monetary policy environment makes it reasonable to be optimistic about the sector’s prospects. Consumer spending and household finances remain stable, supported by a decent labor market. Credit demand shows signs of improvement and delinquencies have declined from their peaks despite references to so-called ‘cockroaches.’ For the Finance sector, we now have third-quarter results from 47.7% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies grew more than 20.4% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues, with 96.2% beating EPS estimates and 88.5% beating revenue estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo & Company WFC, Citigroup Inc. C, Goldman Sachs GS, Morgan Stanley MS and Bank of America BAC beat both top and bottom-line estimates in their latest earnings releases. The Finance sector ranks fifth out of the 16 Zacks classified sectors. The Financial - Investment Bank category, which most big banks come from, is also strongly positioned at present. The industry ranks in the top 14% of the 243 industries classified by Zacks. The financials sector currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 10.97X versus 19.88X possessed by the S&P 500. The Financial - Investment Bank industry trades at a forward P/E of 15.61X. Projected EPS Growth of the sector is a solid 8.41% versus the S&P 500’s growth of 6.88%. The Financial - Investment Bank industry’s growth is 14.45%. The financials sector currently has a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.34X than the S&P 500’s 0.58X. The Financial - Investment Bank industry’s debt-to-equity ratio is even lower at 0.15X. The Fed is currently cutting interest rates. If risk-on sentiment in the market holds (assuming the so-called AI bubble doesn’t burst), long-term bond yields are likely to rise, while short-term yields will decline due to the Fed’s rate cuts. This would steepen the yield curve — a positive for the banking sector — by boosting banks’ net interest margins. However, healthy credit demand is necessary to support gains in the net interest margins. Against this backdrop, financials exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF IYG, iShares US Financials ETF IYF, Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB, Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF and Vanguard Financials ETF VFH, should gain ahead.

For more information please view the Barchart Disclosure Policy here Share Most investors are amped up about the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), and rightfully so. However, there are other pockets of the tech sector that are flying right now and are worth covering. One such sector that's seen plenty of love lately is quantum computing. Most investors are aware of the big players in this space. But there are some under-the-radar plays within the quantum computing realm I think are important to touch on. In this article, I'm going to highlight Arqit Quantum (ARQQ) and why this is a stock investors should pay attention to. News this past week that J.P. Morgan (JPM) is looking to make direct venture capital and equity investments in key quantum computing stocks , including Arqit, led to a sharp rally in shares of this relatively undiscovered quantum computing name. This chart above shows just how violent the move up and down has been following this news. Now, shares of Arqit are still trading much higher than their Q1 and Q2 levels. But the roughly 50% drawdown we've seen in recent days may be concerning to some. I think some of this has to do with the relatively low volume for shares of ARQQ stock. With roughly one million shares traded daily, it's clear that only a fraction of the company's shares are trading hands. That said, volume has been picking up as this company gets more attention, and I'd think this trend will continue. The fact that J.P. Morgan is among the leading institutional investors stepping into the quantum computing space in a big way and tapping Arqit as a name they're specifically calling out is good news for investors considering this stock. The question will be whether J.P. Morgan and other banks and institutional money managers choose to follow suit and add exposure to this stock over time. For now, at least, the jury remains out on this front. In terms of Arqit's fundamentals, it's apparent that this company is a ways away from profitability. Indeed, that profit margin number alone is one that investors are clearly ignoring. Most who understand the quantum computing sector (at least at a high level) know that there's going to need to be a tremendous amount of capital deployed before real progress takes hold. And while Arqit has made some interesting breakthroughs, this company won't likely buck the spending trend we're seeing in this space, at least not for a few years. The company's price/sales (P/S) ratio is also astronomical, given the fact that the company's overall revenue is so small. That said, investors today are buying these stocks for a decade or two down the road. Over such a time frame, it's entirely likely that Arqit (valued at a little more than $600 million at the time of writing) could turn out to be a bargain. That is, if this technology is what everyone is making it out to be, perhaps picking up shares of this profitless company before it really turns heads could be the best move. What's interesting about the consensus price target below is that the two analysts covering this stock both came to the same conclusion—that ARQQ stock should be worth roughly 50% more than it is today. This kind of upside isn't new for companies in the quantum computing space. But what is different for a company like Arqit is the relative lack of analyst coverage. Having only two analysts covering this name, both of whom put a price target on this stock right around where it was trading after the J.P. Morgan announcement, may seem like not enough upside for some investors. Fair enough on that sentiment. That said, I still happen to think that 50% upside in any given stock deserves a look, particularly from investors who have a long-term investing time horizon and an appetite for risk. On those metrics, ARQQ stock is one to put on the watchlist. That's precisely what I've done after my initial dive into this name.",686,en,0.24
JPM,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/acuity-dine-brands-global-highlighted-143400666.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/acuity-dine-brands-global-highlighted-143400666.html,finance.yahoo.com,,Yahoo Finance,2025-10-20T14:34:00.000Z,2025-10-20T14:34:00Z,Acuity and Dine Brands Global have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7fbc49d3816805b0ea61bdd1e02193f8c12c766916f6e801a1b9ff568a791e2c,Acuity and Dine Brands Global have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"Acuity shines as Zacks' Bull of the Day on breakout potential and strong earnings, while Dine Brands faces mounting pressure as the Bear of the Day.","Chicago, IL – October 20, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Acuity Inc. (AYI) as the Bull of the Day and Dine Brands Global, Inc. DIN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Zions Bancorporation ZION, Western Alliance Bancorp. WAL and JPMorgan JPM . Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Acuity Inc. is a market-beating, high-tech lighting, energy efficiency, and building systems stock on the cusp of a potential breakout, while trading at value-stock levels. AYI benefits from reshoring, AI data center expansion, and the broader push for energy efficiency and connected smart spaces across the economy. Acuity completed two acquisitions in FY25 and posted a beat-and-raise Q4 FY25 report in early October. The industrial technology company is expected to post double-digit earnings growth in FY26 and FY27, and its upbeat earnings estimates have earned AYI a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Acuity stock has soared 1,200% in the past 20 years, crushing the S&P 500. Despite trading near its recent all-time highs, the dividend-paying stock trades at a 40% discount to its peaks on the valuation front—which is an increasingly attractive quality for best-in-class stocks in a seemingly overheated market. In its own words, Acuity uses ""technology to solve problems in spaces, light, and more things to come."" AYI reports via Acuity Brands Lighting and Acuity Intelligent Spaces, aiming to grow across lighting, lighting controls, building management solutions, as well as audio, video, control platform solutions, and beyond. The Atlanta-based firm's growing portfolio of lighting and connected smart building solutions operates across the entire economy, from commercial office spaces, retail, and residential to industrial, infrastructure, and healthcare. Acuity's lighting offerings are at the cutting edge of the modern connected world, focused on saving energy and constantly adapting to current needs. Beyond lighting, Acuity's technologies help control and improve systems like heating, air conditioning, security, audio/video tech, and more. Connected smart offices and buildings are the future as companies of all shapes and sizes race to become as efficient and adaptable as possible. Acuity's portfolio is also prepared to grow alongside the rise of power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers desperate to save every last bit of energy they can. Broader long-term trends across reshoring and infrastructure spending provide additional wind in AYI's sails. The company boosted its portfolio via two acquisitions (QSC and M3 Innovation) in fiscal 2025. The company also raised its dividend by 13% last year, while boasting a low payout ratio of 4%, which provides it with long-term runway for more hikes. AYI posted solid beat-and-raise fourth quarter FY25 results on October 1. It grew its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 16% in fiscal 2025 and its revenue by 13%. The company is set to follow that up with 10% revenue growth in FY26 and 5.4% growth in FY27 to reach $5 billion—up from $3.8 billion in FY24. The industrial smart lighting company is projected to grow its adjusted EPS by roughly 10% in FY26 and FY27. AYI has topped our quarterly earnings estimates for five years running. More importantly, its EPS revisions picture began to climb again after its strong Q4, earning Acuity a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and restarting its strong upward earnings revisions trend over the past five years. Acuity is gaining more attention from Wall Street recently. Zacks has nine brokerage recommendations for AYI, up from seven three months ago, with six coming in at ""Strong Buys."" Plus, the company has a solid balance sheet that will support further expansion, dividends, and other initiatives that will benefit investors in the long run. Acuity skyrocketed 1,200% over the past 20 years, more than doubling the S&P 500. The stock has climbed 72% in the past decade to outclimb its Zacks Business Services sector's 55%. Despite this run, AYI didn't break out meaningfully above its previous 2016 peaks until the last year. Its 110% charge in the past two years helped it wash away a rough stretch from 2016 to the stock market's Covid lows in 2020. The stock is trading just below its new all-time highs and 6% under its average Zacks price target. AYI completed a bullish golden cross in early August, with its 50-day moving average crossing above its 200-day. On top of that, its long-term 21-week moving average crossed above its 50-week in September. The stock might face selling pressure in the short-term and possibly test its 21-day, 50-day, or even 200-day moving average. Pullbacks to those levels could mark strong entry points for traders. Long-term investors might not want to play the market-timing game on AYI stock, given its broader bull case that's cemented by its valuation. Acuity trades at a 10% discount to its Zacks sector, even though it has outperformed that group. Better yet, AYI trades at a 40% discount to its highs and near its 20-year median at 19.1X forward 12-month earnings. At the same time, the AI-boosted rebound has the S&P 500 trading near some of its highest valuation levels in the past 20 years. Acuity's valuation levels, coupled with its growth outlook and other key fundamentals, could help it gain even more momentum and attention from Wall Street. Dine Brands Global, Inc. stock has tanked 60% in the past three years, while its Zacks sector climbed 65% and its Retail–Restaurants industry climbed 12%. The restaurant giant behind Applebee's and other chains has a rough balance sheet, and its earnings revisions have tumbled over the past several years as Dine Brands struggles to navigate multiple headwinds. Dine Brands operates restaurants via subsidiaries and franchisees under the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill + Bar, IHOP, and Fuzzy's Taco Shop brands. The Pasadena, California-headquartered company boasted that its portfolio consisted of roughly 3,500 restaurants across 19 international markets as of June 30. DIN has struggled since its massive post-Covid lockdown boom that benefited every area of the consumer economy. Since then, soaring inflation and slowing consumer spending have hurt revenue and crushed its bottom line. On top of that, consumers have more dining options than ever, and more people are trying to eat healthier. The chart above shows that DIN's earnings estimates fell off a cliff over the past several years. Dine Brands missed our Q2 earnings estimate by 22% and provided downbeat earnings per share (EPS) guidance. DIN's Most Accurate estimates came in well below consensus for Q3, FY25, and FY26 (see below). Dine Brands' overall negative EPS revisions earn the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some investors might want to start bottom-feeding on Dine Brands stock since it's trading near its Covid lows while the broader stock market sits near fresh records. But it might be wise to stay away from DIN since it has underperformed its industry by a wide margin over the past 10 years (down -68% vs. its industry's +75% climb). The Retail–Restaurants space is in the bottom 15% of roughly 240 Zacks industries. This amplifies its near-term bear case since studies have shown that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its industry group. And the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. On top of that, Dine Brands has more liabilities (total and current) than assets (total and current). Yesterday, U.S. stock indices declined sharply after regional banks Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance Bancorp. disclosed loan losses and fraud allegations. Zions and Western Alliance stocks tanked and closed the session down 13.1% and 10.8%, respectively. The disclosure reignited investor fears about the overall health of the regional banking sector. The concern spread across the broader financial sector, with the KBW Regional Banking Index (KRE) dropping 6.3% and nearly all its constituents closing sharply lower in the session. Zions announced, in a filing, that a $50 million charge-off tied to two troubled commercial loans from its California Bank & Trust division will be included in its third-quarter 2025 results. This involved alleged misrepresentations and contractual defaults by borrowers. ZION is scheduled to announce quarterly numbers on Monday, Oct. 20. Additionally, Western Alliance disclosed a lawsuit against Cantor Group V, LLC over loan fraud. Earlier in the week, it emerged that WAL had exposure to bankrupt auto-related companies such as First Brands Group and Tricolor Holdings. Despite revealing these matters, the company noted that as of Sept. 30, 2025, its total criticized assets are lower on a sequential basis. The bank is slated to report third-quarter numbers on Tuesday, Oct. 21. On Oct. 14, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, while discussing the losses his bank experienced from the downfall of Tricolor Holdings, said it was ""not our finest moment."" JPM disclosed a $170 million charge-off related to its wholesale lending to Tricolor. Further, Dimon warned that there could be many more such issues. He said, ""My antenna goes up when things like that happen. I shouldn't say this, but when you see one cockroach, there's probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one."" Such disclosures by lenders actually highlighted a new reality: fraud is no longer just a compliance issue but a credit quality matter. This raises questions about the risk management and underwriting standards at regional banks, making investors more cautious about the sector's overall health. Investors are now scrutinizing regional banks more closely for other potential hidden loan problems. Although ZION, WAL and JPM emphasized that these exposures were isolated, the market saw them as warning signs of broader credit deterioration, especially with continued bankruptcies and fraud surfacing in the opaque private credit market. These incidents heightened concerns about the rapidly expanding private credit market. The spike in loan troubles and fraud risk has put regional lenders at the forefront of market turbulence. This has also renewed anxieties about overall credit quality and potential ripple effects through the U.S. financial system. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The largest U.S. banks recently reported third-quarter earnings, and for the most part, it was a blowout. Both JPMorgan Chase ( JPM +0.28% ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC +0.53% ) raised forecasts for net interest income, one of their primary sources of revenue, and credit costs seemed manageable. But one of the big takeaways came from Wells Fargo, when management provided an outlook for significantly higher returns on equity. Its targets are now comparable to best-in-class JPMorgan, which is why the country's largest and arguably strongest bank may want to be on the lookout. The presidential election of Donald Trump brings a much more favorable regulatory environment for banks. Coming into the year, Wells Fargo still operated under an asset cap after a series of regulatory violations, preventing the bank from expanding for more than seven years. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Expanding the balance sheet and reaping more interest income from loans and other assets is one of the main ways banks make money. The Federal Reserve had placed an asset cap on Wells Fargo in 2018 as punishment for the bank's phony-accounts scandal , in which employees opened unauthorized customer accounts to meet performance quotas. Although I do think Wells Fargo would have eventually gotten the asset cap removed, Trump's regulatory regime expedited the process. Now the bank, which has already been improving returns under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf, can play offense, and in Q3, Scharf seemed to remove the training wheels. Scharf said the bank is now targeting a 17% to 18% return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) in the medium term, although he did not define how long the medium term is. Still, this is a significant increase in management's internal targets. Wells Fargo only earned an 8% ROTCE in 2020 but has made significant progress during the past five years, achieving a 15% ROTCE year to date. Scharf took over in 2019. While spending significant time on transforming the bank's regulatory infrastructure, he also significantly cut expenses and focused on the bank's core U.S. banking business, and on higher-returning operations like credit cards, as well as more capital-efficient businesses like investment banking. On the company's Q3 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Michael Santomassimo also said he sees a good opportunity to expand margins in wealth management and lending, where the bank is undersized compared to peers. Scharf also noted these new return targets depend on interest rates, the macro environment, and the future regulatory climate. These returns are also based on the bank bringing one of its key regulatory ratios -- its common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, a measure of core capital to risk-weighted assets like loans -- down from 11% to a range of 10% to 10.5%. Generally, the less capital a bank holds the higher returns it can generate. For many years now, JPMorgan Chase has targeted a 17% ROTCE through the interest rate and economic cycle. But it has overdelivered for a number of years. In fact, during the past four quarters the bank hasn't reported less than a 20% ROTCE. This is also happening as the bank continues to hold a ton of excess capital and well over a 15% CET1 until last quarter when it dropped to 14.8%. The bank's regulatory requirement is 11.5%. However, as recently as the bank's Q2 earnings call, CEO Jamie Dimon maintains that the bank's ROTCE target is still 17%. Now, I think Wall Street analysts believe it will ultimately be higher, especially if the bank is able to lower its CET1 ratio, which should be attainable at some point, especially if the current administration makes good on its promise to deregulate the sector and lower capital and liquidity requirements. But Dimon may be waiting until new regs are etched in stone because of all of the proposed changes to bank regulatory capital and liquidity requirements over the years. In theory though, if Wells Fargo executes on its 17%-18% ROTCE goal and JPMorgan does not maintain its elevated ROTCE, which management has not committed to yet, perhaps the valuation gap between the two stocks will close. JPM Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts. But it's too early to assume this yet. JPMorgan's premium comes from several factors including Dimon himself, who is revered in the banking industry, as well as the bank's many strong revenue streams from credit card lending, investment banking, and its lesser-known but very strong payments business. Also, since Q3 2023, JPMorgan has only generated less than a 17% ROTCE once. In every other quarter, it reported at least a 19% ROTCE. Still, the fact that Scharf, a former Dimon protégé, and Wells Fargo are now targeting roughly the same ROTCE as JPMorgan is noteworthy, and I'm sure it's caught JPMorgan's attention.

Analyst commentary on Eurobank Ergasias Services and Holdings has recently focused on target price adjustments and the rationale behind outlooks. Perspectives highlight both optimism on growth execution and cautions regarding valuation and risk. 🐂 Bullish Takeaways JPMorgan increased its price target on Eurobank to EUR 4.10 from EUR 3.60 and maintained an Overweight rating. This reflects JPMorgan's continued confidence in the company's underlying growth momentum and operational execution. Bullish analysts highlight robust execution and improving transparency as key strengths for Eurobank, supporting their positive view. 🐻 Bearish Takeaways Despite target upgrades, some analysts caution that valuation is becoming less compelling and that much of the expected upside may already be reflected in the current share price.

A war of words has erupted over the health of the U.S. credit markets, with Blue Owl Capital Inc. (NYSE: OWL ) co-CEO Marc Lipschultz firing back at a stark warning from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon . In response to Dimon's comment that recent bankruptcies are like seeing a “cockroach” that suggests more are hidden, Lipschultz quipped, “I guess he’s saying there might be a lot more cockroaches at JPMorgan.” Speaking at the CAIS Alternative Investment Summit , Lipschultz rejected the idea that the multi-billion dollar collapse of auto-parts supplier First Brands signals a systemic problem in private credit. Trending: Amazon and NVIDIA Partnered With This Robot Chef — Now Individual Investors Can Too He dismissed the widespread concern as “an odd kind of fear-mongering.” He argued that the failure was an isolated incident of alleged “major fraud” within the traditional syndicated loan market—the domain of large banks—not the direct lending space. Lipschultz contended that the market turmoil should instead prompt a “flight to safety” away from syndicated bank debt and into private credit, which he described as “incredibly healthy.” However, this optimistic view faces a strong counterargument from prominent economist Mohamed El-Erian . Siding firmly with Dimon, the Allianz chief economic adviser said in an interview with CNBC that the recent credit issues are a predictable consequence of a long period of easy money. “I agree with what Jamie Dimon said, which is, you know, cockroaches don’t come in ones and twos,” El-Erian stated. He explained that years of “incredibly loose” credit and lax standards have created an environment where more defaults are inevitable, even if they don’t pose a systemic risk to the entire economy. See Also: The ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.81/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In The debate was ignited by the bankruptcies of First Brands and subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings. These events have amplified fears of credit deterioration, rattling investors and contributing to significant sell-offs in regional bank stocks. Moreover, Zions Bancorporation NA (NASDAQ: ZION ) announced on Wednesday evening that it had incurred a sizable charge due to bad loans to a couple of borrowers. Meanwhile, Western Alliance Bancorp (NYSE: WAL ) alleged on Thursday that a borrower had committed fraud. Additionally, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE: KRE ) plunged 6.20% on Thursday, logging its worst single-day performance since April 4. The S&P 500 index ended 0.63% lower at 6,629.07 on Thursday, whereas the Nasdaq 100 index dipped 0.36% to 24,657.24. On the other hand, Dow Jones fell 0.65% to 45,952.24. On Friday, the futures of the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq 100 indices were trading lower.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash.

On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

However, its shares dropped nearly 10% on earnings news. Bullish or bearish, there’s an options strategy for you.","All information and data in this article is solely for informational purposes. For more information please view the Barchart Disclosure Policy here Share Tennessee-based regional bank First Horizon (FHN) reported its Q3 2025 results yesterday, before the markets opened. While they were reasonably strong, they weren't enough for investors, causing FHN stock to decline nearly 10% on the day. The price drop could have been an example of the adage, “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” Alternatively, it might have been due to the fear-mongering by JPMorgan & Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, whose comments about cockroaches generated considerable controversy. Whatever the reasons, it was a blow for long-time First Horizon shareholders, erasing 75% of their gains in 2025. On the plus side, they’re still up 98% over the past five years, more than double the performance of the iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT) . In yesterday’s options trading, FHN’s volume was 173,468, the second-highest daily volume in 2025, 5.8 times the 30-day average. As a result of the increased activity, the regional bank’s stock had 11 unusually active options yesterday — eight calls and three puts — with two in the top 12. Whether you’re bullish or bearish on its stock, First Horizon’s unusual options activity reveals three standout trades. I’m going to reach outside my comfort zone on this one, opting for a Stock Repair strategy, also known as a Covered Ratio Spread. It’s not something I’ve recommended before. There’s a first time for everything. In this situation, you already own 200 shares of First Horizon stock. We’ll say you bought them on Dec. 31, 2024, at the day’s low of $20.04. Based on yesterday’s closing price, you’re sitting on a slight loss over eight months. You use this strategy to recover some or all of your original $4,008 investment, and if possible, some of the profits lost from yesterday’s trading. You are unwilling to buy more shares. The strategy combines a Covered Call and a Bull Call Spread. You want to buy one ATM (at the money) call and sell two calls with a higher strike price. Of the eight calls from yesterday’s unusual options activity, three had expiration dates of around 90. In this example, you would buy one long $21 call expiring on January 16, 2026, and sell two short $22 or $28 calls. The premium income from the two short calls would be $160 for the $22 call and $10 for the $28 call. Clearly, the former is the bet to make of the two. Let’s assume that on Jan. 16, the share price of FHN stock is $23, the Oct. 14th closing price, the day before yesterday’s correction. 1. The profit on the 200 shares would be $592 [$23 share price at expiration - $20.04 price paid * 200 shares]. 2. The profit on the long $21 call would be $45 [$23 share price at expiration - $21 strike price - $1.55 ask price]. 3. The profit on the two short $22 calls is $160 [bid price of $0.80 * 200 shares]. So, in this example, your total profit would be $797, a return of 19.1% [$797 / $4,163 ($4,008 cost of 200 shares + $155 premium for long call]. Note: The biggest risk to this strategy is if the shares continue to decline in the next 94 days and you don’t sell your shares. I selected this strategy primarily for demonstration purposes. I wouldn’t try it unless you’re confident the shares will rebound from yesterday’s correction. This next strategy is also new to me. I’m really pushing my boundaries today. The Call Ratio Back Spread is an extremely bullish strategy that looks to benefit from a stock’s near-term significant upside. In this example, you would sell one short call and buy two higher strike calls. Ideally, the short call is ATM or ITM (in the money), while the two long calls are OTM (out of the money). All three have the same DTE (days to expiration). Referencing the 11 unusually active options from yesterday, the Jan. 16/2026 DTE is the only reasonable setup for this strategy. So, sell the short $21 call and buy two long $22 or $28 calls. The net debit when combined with the long $22 call would be $85 [2 * $22 strike’s ask price of $1.15 - $21 strike’s bid price of $1.45]. The net credit for the long $28 call would be $95 [$21 strike’s bid price of $1.45 - 2 * $28 strike’s ask price of $0.25]. The maximum loss for the long $22 call would be $1.85 or $185 [$22 long call strike price - $21 short call strike price + $0.85 net debit]. The maximum loss for the long $28 call would be $6.05 or $605 [$28 long call strike price - $21 short call strike price - $0.95 net credit]. The maximum profit for both long call strike prices is unlimited, depending on how much the share price appreciates over the next three months above the upper breakeven price. The $22 long call’s upper breakeven price is $23.85 [$22 strike price + ($22 long call strike price - $21 short call strike price) + $0.85 net debit. The $28 long call’s upper breakeven price is $34.05 [$28 strike price + ($28 long call strike price - $21 short call strike price) - $0.95 net credit. The $22 long call is the better play in this instance. The most straightforward of the three options’ strategies is the Bear Put Spread. You use this when you are bullish about the future share price of a stock. It involves buying a long put option at one strike price and selling a lower-priced short put option. The strategy has limited profits and losses, making it a good play for risk-averse investors. First Horizon had three unusually active put options yesterday, two of which expire on Nov. 21. They’ll be the ones to use for this strategy. Here’s what I see in late Thursday morning trading. So, you’re buying one long $18 put at an ask price of $0.40 and selling one short $17 put at a bid price of $0.10, for a net debit of $0.30 or $30. That’s also your maximum loss. The maximum profit is $70, which is the strike price differential of $1 minus the $0.30 net debit. The risk/reward is 0.43 to 1, calculated as the maximum loss divided by the maximum profit. Meanwhile, the maximum profit percentage is 233.33%, calculated as the maximum profit divided by the maximum loss. Of course, the breakeven is $17.70 [$18 long call - $0.30 net debit], which means First Horizon’s share price must fall by at least 13.45% in the next 36 days to make a profit on this trade. That explains why the profit probability is just 11.4%. Fortunately, at $30 per bear put spread, the cost isn’t a dealbreaker.",1147,en,0.24

Jamie Dimon isn't buying the AI bubble hype, but he's not sugarcoating the fallout either. In an interview with Fortune, the JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) CEO doubled down on his belief that artificial intelligence is not a fad and that the payoff will come. But it will replace jobs at a pace that could cause major problems if governments and businesses fail to prepare. ""You'll have a revolution,"" Dimon cautioned. Trending: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Invest Now at Just $0.81 a Share Dimon compared the current AI hype to the early days of the internet, when companies like Google and Meta emerged as major technology players. He said he was somewhat cautious about conditions in the current market, but urged people not to label all of AI as a speculative frenzy. The companies at the center of the AI boom, including OpenAI and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ), are investing billions of dollars in each other. Views on the long-term payoff and the risks have been mixed. Hedge fund manager Howard Marks said current market valuations were ""high, but not crazy."" On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, warned that the AI investment boom might be an economic bubble that could burst, comparable to the dot-com bust in the early 2000s. ""You can't look at AI as a bubble, though some of these things may be in the bubble. In total, it'll probably pay off,"" Dimon said. See Also: Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the $36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property Dimon reiterated his view that AI would eliminate jobs. “People should stop sticking their head in the sand...,” he said. “I do think there should be proper thoughtful regulations and guardrails to protect the public,” referring to being better prepared for the job losses that could come as more companies and industries increasingly deploy AI into their systems and processes. Last week, Dimon, who runs the largest bank in the U.S., said the chances of the U.S. stock market crashing are far greater than many financiers believe, adding that he is “far more worried than others” about a serious market correction, which he predicted could come in the next six months to two years Image via Shutterstock Trending Now: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ? Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey – no cost, no obligation . Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry. Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly. Vinovest lets investors diversify into fine wine — a historically stable, low-volatility asset class that has outperformed the S&P 500 over multiple decades . With professionally managed portfolios, secure storage, and insurance included, users can invest in wine without needing to be experts themselves. Minimums start at $1,000, and investors retain full ownership of their wine, which has the potential to appreciate in value as global demand grows. For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income. Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies. Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets. SoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds , covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible. Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools . Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing. For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

The pair of bankruptcies were a shock for the credit markets, where companies have been borrowing at a record pace while handing investors outsized returns.","(Bloomberg) -- Investors spooked by the implosion of auto lender Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group got little reassurance Tuesday from the head of the biggest US bank. Most Read from Bloomberg HUD Issues Layoff Notices, Targeting Fair Housing Staff With Deep Cuts Affordable Housing Left Vulnerable After Trump Fires Building Inspectors With Roles as Civic Hubs, Libraries Turn Over a New Page DC Tourists Frustrated by Museum Closures as Shutdown Persists Chicago Commuter Rail to Increase Fares to Plug Budget Gap “My antenna goes up when things like that happen,” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief executive officer, said on a call with analysts. “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.” The pair of bankruptcies were a shock for the credit markets, where companies have been borrowing at a record pace while handing investors outsized returns. And Dimon, fresh off posting results that put his bank on track for another record year, said there could be more pain than usual when the economy takes a turn for the worse. “I suspect when there’s a downturn you will see higher-than-normal downturn type of credit losses in certain categories,” he said. “Look at the price of the BDCs and their publicly traded private credit facilities and do the homework,” he said, referring to business development companies. Even as JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. kicked off third-quarter earnings season by posting revenue that beat analysts’ estimates, some of their leaders took turns offering warnings about potential troubles with lending or signs of economic weakness, including in the labor market. While results sent shares of Citigroup and Wells Fargo higher, the downbeat notes and rising compensation costs trimmed prices at JPMorgan and Goldman. In drawing attention to investors’ growing disillusionment with public vehicles that hold private-debt investments, Dimon touched on a niche corner of the market where investors are on the lookout for signs of widening cracks in debt markets. Investors have been fleeing BDCs, seen as a proxy for the $1.7 trillion private-credit market, as they cut distributions available to shareholders. That has opened a widening gap between the broader equity market and private-credit BDC stocks. Last month, the $75 billion non-traded Blackstone Private Credit Fund, the largest in the industry, said it was reducing its shareholder payouts. A growing part of banks’ loan books is providing financing to private-market players that are encroaching on the banks’ traditional commercial lending territory. Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum and his Wells Fargo counterpart, Michael Santomassimo, reassured analysts that much of their exposures are to large, established private-credit players. Still, Dimon offered a caveat. “I expect it to be a little bit worse than other people expect it to be, because we don’t know all the underwriting standards that all these people did,” he said. “They know what they’re doing, they’ve been around a long time, but they’re not all very smart.” At Citigroup, CEO Jane Fraser said growth in the US economy is still humming, while also pointing to signs that some sectors are cooling. She said the bank is keeping a close eye on the US labor market, echoing a similar warning from Dimon, who also reiterated his concern about the risk of sticky inflation. “Just because things are fine now, doesn’t mean they’ll be great forever,” JPMorgan’s Barnum said on the earnings call. Such notes of caution were a sharp contrast to the results being posted by their banks. JPMorgan is on track for another year of record revenue, buoyed by revved up dealmaking, buoyant trading and signs of a resilient US consumer. Citigroup, meanwhile, has emerged as the best performing big US bank stock as it continues to surpass analysts’ estimates under Fraser’s turnaround plan for a bank hamstrung by years of regulatory headaches. JPMorgan’s smaller rival, Goldman, notched its best third-quarter results on record, benefiting the most among its peers from a surge in dealmaking this year. That’s on the back of the busiest quarter for initial public offerings since 2021 and almost $1 trillion of deals announced globally in the three months ending Sept. 30. Still, the Wall Street bank paired strong results with a warning to its staff Tuesday that more job cuts are coming this year as it fends off pressure from rising expenses. Wells Fargo emerged as another third-quarter winner, as it set out higher profitability goals. That comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve releasing the bank from a punitive asset-cap penalty for past misdeeds, which had constrained growth and left the lender falling behind its bigger rivals. Wells Fargo’s new return on tangible common equity target of 17% to 18% offers some signs to investors on how the bank hopes to turbocharge growth. Still, the sudden collapse of Tricolor, which forced a $170 million charge-off at JPMorgan, stands as a flashing yellow light for even the most optimistic investors. “It is not our finest moment,” Dimon said. --With assistance from Olivia Fishlow.

Is JPMorgan Chase's Recent Hit a Warning to Other Major Banks? | The Motley Fool",Did JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon just raise a major red flag that investors need to pay attention to?,"Did JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon just raise a major red flag that investors need to pay attention to? Before market open this morning, JPMorgan Chase ( JPM +0.25% ) published results for the third quarter. Performance for the period actually came in significantly better than the market had anticipated -- with earnings per share of $5.07 on sales of $47.12 billion beating the average analyst estimate's call for per-share earnings of $4.84 on sales of $45.4 billion. On the other hand, the strong quarter also arrived with some commentary from CEO Jamie Dimon and other executives highlighting concerns for the financials sector and broader U.S. economy. Has JPMorgan just raised major warning flags that could signal powerful headwinds for other major banks? Image source: Getty Images. Speaking on losses his company experienced connected to its position in automotive credit supplier Tricolor Holdings, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged that the relationship was not the bank's best moment. Taking it a step further, Dimon said, ""When you see one cockroach, there's probably more."" Tricolor filed for bankruptcy protection last month, and the development has raised concerns about the broader U.S. consumer credit market. In the third quarter, JPMorgan took a $170 million impairment charge connected to loans it had extended to Tricolor. In JPMorgan's third-quarter conference call, Dimon suggested that bankruptcies for Tricolor and other companies in the auto industry raised concerns about whether lending standards had become too lax. Dimon's comments about seeing cockroaches highlight the risk that issues facing the U.S. consumer credit market may be greater than what is visible on the surface. In other words, Tricolor's bankruptcy may be the visible cockroach that signals a much larger nest of bugs that could present issues for the credit market and broader economy. Dimon's comments about Tricolor and consumer credit trends are also seemingly an acknowledgment that JPMorgan could face similar issues in the not-too-distant future. Perhaps more importantly, his comments raise the concern that other large U.S. banks could soon face similar issues that have impacts on the financials sector and U.S. macroeconomic health. Between inflation levels that have remained relatively sticky, uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs , and some concerning indicators for U.S. economic growth, there are a lot of pressure points on the table for the broader macroeconomic picture right now. Shifting geopolitical dynamics with China and other rivals and trade partners present additional risk factors. The U.S. economy is going through some historic shifts at the moment, and there are good reasons to think that some potentially serious fault lines exist in the consumer credit market right now. Dimon's suggestion that Tricolor's bankruptcy and other signs of weakness connected to the auto market signal real credit risks appears well founded, and it wouldn't be shocking to see other major banks dealing with headwinds along those lines in the near future.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid . Are we in an AI bubble? A new Bank of America survey shows a record share of global fund managers now say AI stocks are in bubble territory. That's the highest reading since the boom began. Plus, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond warning that a lot of assets are entering bubble territory. Still big tech isn't slowing down. Google just announced a $15 billion investment to build a massive new data center hub in India. That's its largest outside the US. And while broader markets are lower, AMD is actually popping today on a new chip deal with Oracle, underscoring how much investor demand there still is for AI infrastructure plays. So Michael, quite simply, I'm going to pose this question to you first. It's the question of the year. Are we in an AI bubble? I absolutely believe we are. Um, and I'll give you an example. You just talked about Google doing a big deal that's 19 billion dollars in the past month. We've had open AI, a company that's on pace to do about 13 billion dollars in revenues this year, announce about 1.5 trillion in commitments over the next several years. So, it's interesting when you see the major hyperscalers, whether it be Google, Amazon, Microsoft, uh you know, meta platforms, they're not announcing, you know, deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars now. So I think that's where investors should recognize there's a disconnect. Well, that's I also think that's going to be the big story for earning season. Um, you know, those major hyperscalers will report uh October 29th and 30th right ahead of the November 1st uh tariff potential uh China tariffs. and it will be interesting for the past couple of years they've continually increased their capex guidance. And again, based on the level of open AI deals we've seen now, are we going to see that type of move from these guys? It doesn't seem likely, but it'll be interesting to see how it plays out. Lale, do you agree with Michael there? Are we in an AI bubble? I wouldn't call it an AI bubble. I think, um, we've certainly passed the early discovery, um, phase into what I would call pricing perfection. Um, investors price the story over the over the price, um, and that could mask pure execution, especially for some of the smaller cap firms. However, I don't think that we are seeing a manic investor psychology. I think today's mood is is quite optimistic and there are some elements of FOMO as well, but I wouldn't call it universally euphoric. I think these tech firms are quite strong in terms of their balance sheets again, um, and and and it is a price for perfection story rather than a bubble story.",568,en,0.24

You should consider the JPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (JPSE), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on November 15, 2016. The fund is sponsored by J.P. Morgan. It has amassed assets over $508.94 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market. There's a lot of potential to investing in small cap companies, but with market capitalization below $2 billion, that high potential comes with even higher risk. Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities. When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.29%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.57%. It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector -- about 13.4% of the portfolio. Industrials and Real Estate round out the top three. Looking at individual holdings, Solaris Energy (SEI) accounts for about 0.53% of total assets, followed by Globalstar Inc Common (GSAT) and United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI). The top 10 holdings account for about 4.12% of total assets under management. JPSE seeks to match the performance of the Russell 2000 Diversified Factor Index before fees and expenses. The JP Morgan Diversified Factor US Small Cap Equity Index utilizes a rules-based approach that combines risk-based portfolio construction with multi-factor security selection, including value, quality and momentum factors. The ETF has added about 7.61% so far this year and it's up approximately 6.49% in the last one year (as of 10/23/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $38.20 and $51.70. The ETF has a beta of 1.04 and standard deviation of 19.29% for the trailing three-year period. With about 553 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. JPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JPSE is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space. The Vanguard Small-Cap ETF (VB) and the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) track a similar index. While Vanguard Small-Cap ETF has $68.34 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF has $86.06 billion. VB has an expense ratio of 0.05% and IJR charges 0.06%. Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

Washington & Wall Street Mobilize for Rare Earth Independence Friday, a single “Truth Social” post from US President Donald Trump resulted in a near-instant $2 trillion loss in market value. For market watchers who participated in the April 2025 market, the feeling was all too familiar: any trade escalation between the world’s two largest economies results in a devastating market swoon. Recently, relations between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to be thawing. However, in a long-ranging social media post, President Trump accused China, the world’s largest rare earth processor and producer, of using its monopoly to hold the US captive (China mines ~70% of rare earth minerals and processes ~90% of them). Why Are Rare Earth Elements So Important? Rare earth elements (REE) are a group of 17 chemical elements that are critical components in numerous modern technologies, including medical instruments like MRIs, electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries, smart phones, and jet engines. Rare Earths: The New “Cold War” The second half of the last century culminated in a “Cold War” predominantly between the United States and the Soviet Union. Though no direct fighting between the two adversaries ever took place, the Soviet Union and the United States competed in nuclear supremacy, space exploration, and world leadership. Today, a similar Cold War is taking place between China and the United States. Amid a lopsided trade balance, President Trump has levied wide-ranging tariffs against China. In retaliation, China is using its dominant position in rare earth elements for negotiating leverage. US Government Pushes to Secure Rare Earth Independence Though the rhetoric between the US and China has cooled since President Trump’s Truth Social post, the US appears to be taking no chances. US rare earth stocks, such as Lithium Americas , MP Materials and USA Rare Earth have surged over the past few months following the US government’s acquisition of equity stakes and pledge financial support. Meanwhile, Trilogy Metals Inc jumped more than 200% in a single session earlier this month after the US government took a 10% stake in the company. However, according to a Financial Times report, the US is not finished. According to filings from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the US Department of Defense acquired ~$1 billion in critical minerals. Meanwhile, $7.5 billion has already been earmarked for essential minerals in the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” JPMorgan Chase Enters the Rare Earth Market The US government is not the only force sending rare earth stocks into the stratosphere. JPMorgan Chase , the largest US bank, announced Monday that it will help to create and fund a decade-long $1.5 trillion initiative to support US economic and national security interests (with a focus on supply chain, defense, energy independence, & AI). JPM will pledge up to $10 billion of its own capital. Manhattan Project 2.0: Rare Earth Independence Though rare earth stocks have already soared in 2025, the recent REE news suggests that they are merely at the beginning of a multi-year trend. The US government appears to be taking an “all hands-on deck” approach similar to that of the “Manhattan Project.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the notion, calling the rare earth efforts an equivalent to the COVID-era “Operation Warp Speed.” Bottom Line The $2 trillion market reaction to President Trump’s accusation that China is weaponizing its near-monopoly on critical rare earth elements signals a new “Cold War” over these essential technology components. As a result, the US government is investing billions and securing equity stakes across domestic REE producers, while major private players like JPMorgan Chase launch multi-trillion-dollar initiatives.

Quantum Leaps & Rare Earth Rallies: Decoding the ""Post-Plunge"" Market After a Friday plunge, stocks rebounded strongly on Monday. Below are five newsworthy market areas to monitor: Small Caps Outperform Small caps and the Russell 2000 Index (IWM) were the strongest stocks during Monday’s rebound. IWM gained 2.78% for the session, nearly clawing back all of Friday’s 2.99% loss. We remain constructive on the space as IWM works on a multi-year breakout. Crypto Crashes Amid Overleverage, Rebounds Monday The crypto market experienced its worst single-session market cap drop on Friday. Unfortunately, when President Trump shared his China message, many crypto investors were overleveraged and caught offside, causing a classic liquidation cascade in crypto and crypto proxies like the iShares Bitcoin ETF . MP Materials Soars on Rare-Earth Tensions MP Materials has emerged as a big winner and a hedge of sorts for investors amid the China-US rivalry backdrop. Shares have broken out and are up over 30% this month amid the news about China’s rare-earth restrictions. Because the US government views rare earths as a national security pillar, MP is likely to continue to be a beneficiary as the US decouples from China and other hostile countries. Meanwhile, respected JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently spoke about the need for the US to reduce reliance on foreign nations for rare earths and minerals. AI Energy Stocks Soar Amid Flurry of Positive News The artificial intelligence race between China and the United States is in full swing. While the US is off to an early (albeit, small) lead in the AI race, it is far behind in the energy race. Energy is critical to AI because AI data centers require significant energy. Monday, Bloom Energy spiked 26% after it announced a partnership to provide Brookfield with $5 billion in on-site fuel cells to power AI data centers. Meanwhile, Navitas Semiconductor , bolted 30% after the market close, following an announcement of a deal to help Nvidia power the next wave of AI factories. NVTS makes chips that help to make AI data centers more efficient. Quantum Computing Stocks Continue to Soar Despite Friday’s plunge, investors continued to pile into high-octane quantum computing stocks. QC stocks are the top 2025 performers. Rigetti Computing has rewarded shareholders with an astonishing 6,000% return thus far in 2025. Bottom Line Despite the Friday sell-off, Wall Street’s strongest industry themes reasserted themselves Monday. Quantum computing, rare earth, and AI energy stocks led the way.

(JPM) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,"According to the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), one should invest in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). It is debatable whether this highly sought-after metric is effective because Wall Street analysts' recommendations tend to be overly optimistic. Would it be worth investing in the stock?","The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). JPMorgan Chase & Co. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.97, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.97 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 51.7% and 10.3% of all recommendations. Check price target & stock forecast for JPMorgan Chase & Co. here>>> While the ABR calls for buying JPMorgan Chase & Co., it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether. Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them. On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns. There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices. In terms of earnings estimate revisions for JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.8% over the past month to $20.12. Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for JPMorgan Chase & Co.

AAPL expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter. However, gross margin is expected to be 46-47% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, including a tariff impact of $1.1 billion.

Business expansion efforts, loan demand and changes in interest rates will drive net interest income (NII). While normal deal-making activity is tied to the economy's health, the bank's solid pipeline and leadership position have generated continued growth in the investment banking (IB) business thus far. Its enhanced capital distributions seem sustainable. At the same time, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates may hurt fee income. As it invests in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain elevated. Weak asset quality due to a tough macroeconomic backdrop is a woe.

This microcap company with a market capitalization of $74.14 million is facing challenges, such as gross margin compression from inventory buildup (32.2% in Q2), ongoing volatility in the Product ID segment (-8.9% YoY revenue), stagnant Aerospace OEM sales, and weak cash conversion weigh on execution. With the stock trading at a deep discount to peers (0.59x EV/sales vs. 5.99x sub-industry), valuation is compelling. Nevertheless, AstroNova is repositioning for margin expansion and earnings growth via a strategic shift to higher-margin ToughWriter 640 printers, now 50% of Aerospace shipments and expected to exceed 80% by FY26-end. A $3M cost reduction program enhances operating leverage, while $4.5M in 1H FY26 free cash flow and reduced net debt strengthen financial flexibility. Proprietary printhead technology supports vertical integration, recurring revenues and supply chain control. FY26 guidance (revenue: $149-$154M, EBITDA margin: 7.5%-8.5%) signals confidence in a second-half recovery.

Illustrating its ongoing dominance and leadership in the banking industry, JPMorgan was able to continue its impressive streak of surpassing quarterly expectations last Tuesday. More applaudable, JPMorgan has taken center stage regarding strategic investments that align with national security priorities and has positioned itself as a key player in shaping the future of the American economy through technology. Trading just under $300 a share, JPM is up over +20% this year, but does offer a 6% discount from its 52-week high of $318, which it hit in late September. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Assisting the U.S. Government in a plan to ramp up domestic production of rare earth minerals that are critical for defense and tech industries, JPMorgan has launched a “Security and Resilience Initiative” in which it will deploy $1.5 trillion in financing over the next decade to support America’s strategic manufacturing, technological innovation, and infrastructure. Notably, this will include $10 billion in direct equity and venture capital investments in U.S.-based companies. This comes as China has long dominated the rare earth supply chain and has recently exercised tighter export restrictions for these essential commodities as part of its tariff retaliation against the U.S. Strengthening its relationships with policymakers and regulators, JPMorgan stands to benefit by enhancing its long-term lending portfolio in high-growth markets that are likely to receive more government support and public interest. Regarding its short-term outlook, fiscal 2025 and FY26 earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher since JPMorgan’s Q3 report. Seeing strength in investment banking, JPMorgan’s trading revenue hit a record in Q3, boosting its top line 9% to $46.42 billion compared to $42.65 billion in the prior year quarter. Even better, net income reached $14.4 billion or $5.07 per share, a 16% increase from EPS of $4.37 in Q3 2024. JPMorgan has now surpassed sales estimates for seven straight quarters and has exceeded earnings expectations for 13 consecutive quarters. Over the last four quarters, JPM has had an average sales and earnings surprise of 3.81% and 11.01% respectively. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Attributing to its strong buy rating is that FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates for JPM are up nearly 1% in the last seven days. In the last month, FY25 and FY26 EPS revisions have risen over 2% and are up more than 4% over the last quarter. JPMorgan's annual earnings are now expected to be up over 1% this year and projected to rise another 4% in FY26 to $20.90 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Outside of JPMorgan’s operational efficiency, there have been strong indicators of efficient capital deployment, including a 17% ROE with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) hitting 20%. Indicative of a bank’s financial strength and stability, JPMorgan’s standardized and advanced Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios are currently above 14%. It’s noteworthy that JPM posted the highest CET1 mark among the 22 largest U.S. banks in the Federal Reserve’s 2025 stress test at 12.5%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Supportive of the in-depth details as to why JPM stock looks hot right now, the cherry on top is that the rising EPS revisions have magnified its reasonable forward P/E valuation of 15X. Plus, JPM is offering a generous 1.98% annual dividend of $1.50 per share, after increasing its yield by 20% so far this year. In addition to its strong buy rating, JPM stands out with an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Momentum. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These Are the Top-Performing Names to Buy Now.,These quantum computing stocks have accelerated even more after J.P. Morgan Chase announced a major investment.,"All information and data in this article is solely for informational purposes. For more information please view the Barchart Disclosure Policy here Share J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) announced a major $1.5 trillion ""Security and Resiliency Initiative"" on Oct. 13, with $10 billion earmarked for direct equity investments across four strategic sectors that include quantum computing. The other three are defense and aerospace, energy independence, and AI. It's a part of their "" frontier and strategic technologies "" focus, and it caused an immediate and significant rally in quantum computing stocks. According to CEO Jamie Dimon, ""It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing—all of which are essential for our national security."" The market saw the investment as a sign that quantum computing is now considered indispensable for the U.S. to stay competitive. The following three pure-play quantum computing stocks can gain the most from this: D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) has been delivering very aggressive gains this past year and is up 3,558% as of this writing . Shareholders can thank the extremely successful PR offensive carried out by the company's management, along with several genuine breakthroughs that the company managed to translate into a higher stock price. Then, management turned the surging stock price into a positive feedback loop. At-the-market offerings drove net cash on the balance sheet high enough to fund years of operations. D-Wave currently has $819.3 million in cash as of Q2, and its free cash flow loss for the quarter was $35.88 million . One could expect the cash runway to get even bigger, as the company's financing cash flow in Q2 was positive due to about $681 million worth of common stock being issued that quarter, up from $146.13 million in Q1. For most companies, this sort of dilution would cause the stock to crater, but it lifted QBTS stock instead due to the cash making it likelier that D-Wave will be able to fund significant quantum computing research and deliver genuine breakthroughs. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) hasn't been focused on making a splash in the media, but the quantum computing bonanza has still turned it into the second-hottest name among quantum pure-play stocks. This is thanks to the stock more than doubling in just the past month. Rigetti has partnerships in the space, and the most recent news included the announcement of purchase orders for two quantum computing systems for $5.7 million, along with a $5.8 million Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) contract. The company launched its 36-qubit Cepheus-1 system in August 2025 and aims to release a system with over 100 qubits by the end of 2025. RGTI stock is up 4,809% in the past year . IonQ (IONQ) has been a long-time heavyweight in the quantum pure-play space, so its bigger size before the current hype surrounding quantum computing has caused IONQ stock to gain ""only"" 400.4% in the past year. However, it remains the biggest pure-play company in the sector with a market cap of $19 billion. And as D-Wave and Rigetti close the valuation gap, they could deliver explosive gains in parallel. IonQ's larger initial size has allowed it to rack up significant partnerships. This includes General Dynamics (GD) Information Technology (GDIT) for government and defense, Hyundai Motor, AWS, Nvidia (NVDA) , and more. IonQ claims it leads the market with ""the first and only quantum hardware integrated with all major cloud platforms, quantum programming languages, and quantum software developer kits"". The company also hired former JPM head of applied research Marco Pistoia as its senior vice president of industry relations. This can help it grab more investments from J.P. Morgan.",616,en,0.12

How readers voted,Fears are growing that huge investment in AI could lead to a bubble on the scale of the dot-com crash.,"It's been a jittery week for the stock markets, particularly as warnings that an AI bubble is on the horizon have grown louder. Many companies that are creating AI products or providing the infrastructure that supports the technology have achieved sky-high valuations in recent months. Industry watchers have compared the situation with the bursting of the dot-com bubble around 25 years ago, which wreaked havoc on global stock markets.

Not everyone agrees that we will see a repeat of the dot-com chaos, however. Ben Barringer, global head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, didn't believe we were in bubble territory and that valuations remain ""well below"" the tech bubble of 1999-2000.

Being a prime beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Act, which has an emphasis on incentivizing and investing in clean energy and climate initiatives, more long-term visibility demand is on the horizon amid increased government funding for renewable energy. This comes as First Solar’s U.S. production facilities are reportedly sold out through 2028, with the company specializing in cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar modules that offer superior performance compared to traditional silicon panels. As a reminder that the all-time high for First Solar stock is over $300 a share, FSLR has spiked +10% so far this month and is now up nearly +40% year to date. Recently hitting a fresh 52-week peak of $248, this certainly begs the question of whether it's time to buy the surge in FSLR before it gets more expensive or if there will still be better buying opportunities ahead. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Propelling FSLR is that First Solar is expected to post strong Q3 results on Thursday, October 30. Zacks' projections call for First Solar’s Q3 sales to be up an eye-popping 74% to $1.54 billion compared to $887.67 million in the prior year quarter. Taking advantage of this impressive top line expansion, First Solar’s earnings are expected to climb 46% to $4.24 per share versus EPS of $2.91 in Q3 2024. With investors being lured by foreseeable expectations of high double-digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2025 and FY26, FSLR has been on a tear since breaking out above its 50-day and 200-day SMAs in July. Previously, at the end of last year, the drop in First Solar’s 50-day SMA (green line) below the 200-day SMA (red line) led to an extended downtrend in FSLR before the reemergence of several catalysts, including the clarification of what ended up being favorable policy changes regarding updated rules for clean energy tax credits and federal incentives. First Solar’s 50-day and 200-day SMA support levels are currently at roughly $169 and $210 a share, respectively. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research At current levels, FSLR still trades at a reasonable 16X forward earnings multiple despite such an extensive rally in recent months. From a historical perspective, First Solar stock not only offers a nice discount to the benchmark S&P 500 and many of its solar peers but also trades more than 20% from its decade-long median of 21X, with an extreme high of over 1,500X during this period. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Blowing past its current Average Zacks Price Target of $231.17, several analysts have recently upgraded their price targets for First Solar stock to over $260. This includes analysts at BMO Capital BMO , Jefferies Financial Group JEF , and JPMorgan JPM , w ith Citigroup C currently having the street high price target of $300. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Most influential to Zacks' proprietary ranking system is the trend of earnings estimate revisions (EPS), with FSLR currently landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the last quarter, EPS revisions for First Solar are still positive but have dipped in the last week for FY25 and FY26. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Although it’s very enticing to chase the rally, the technical analysis of FSLR also shows how this stock can be very volatile and influenced by these trading indicators. It’s understandable how FOMO could be setting in, but the possibility of better buying opportunities is not off the table, even with new emerging catalysts such as the use of solar energy to support AI infrastructure.

Investors on Thursday punished the stocks of regional banks and an investment bank exposed to the bankruptcy of an auto parts maker. The regional banks that plummeted on Thursday were Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorporation ( WAL ) and Salt Lake City's Zions Bancorporation ( ZION ). Zions' stock fell 13% and Western Alliance's stock fell nearly 10%, though both were clawing back some of that loss in Friday's premarket. Their pullbacks came after Zions on Wednesday said it took a $50 million charge-off — a measure of unpaid debt written off as a loss — for two business loans extended through its California Bank & Trust division. The regional bank said it made the decision after it ""became aware of legal actions initiated by several banks and other lenders"" affiliated with two of its borrowers and an internal review of its own portfolio. The drop in Western Alliance came after it said on Thursday that it filed a lawsuit ""alleging fraud by the borrower"" over a revolving credit facility to an entity called Cantor Group V LLC. The disclosures are the latest in a series of developments that have worried Wall Street as investors look for signs that credit among commercial customers is weakening. The concerns started with two recent and sizable bankruptcies in September: subprime auto lender Tricolor and larger auto parts supplier First Brands. A spokesperson for Zions said the disclosed loans “in question are not related to First Brands or TriColor.” A spokesperson for Western Alliance said its disclosed loan is ""not related to First Brands or TriColor and is an isolated credit incident."" The aftermath revealed a web of exposures among large Wall Street players, including Jefferies Financial Group ( JEF ). A fund controlled by Jefferies' asset management unit has $715 million in receivables owed by First Brands customers, according to court filings published earlier this month. Executives have been trying to assure investors that the impact on the firm will be manageable. The company published a letter to shareholders from Jefferies CEO Richard Handler and president Brian Friedman, noting that Jefferies' exposure was ""readily absorbable"" and that the impact to the company's stock and credit perception was ""meaningfully overdone."" The firm's investment exposure is effectively ""$43 million in accounts receivable"" and ""$2 million of interest on First Brands' bank loans,"" the executives said. Yet, investors still sent the company's stock down more than 10% Thursday. ""We take the elephant in the room very seriously, and we're going to do our work to do what needs to be done to optimize the result for our stakeholders, and also learn ourselves how we can be better,"" longtime Jefferies CEO Richard Handler said Thursday during the firm's annual investor day. ""I personally talk to a lot of investors, a lot of CEOs, a lot of operating businesses. I think the environment is generally pretty darn good. I don't see this as the canary in the coal mine,"" Handler added. Another event that may have spooked some investors came during JPMorgan's earnings day, as the CEO of the largest US bank issued both a mea culpa and a stark warning when discussing the losses his bank experienced from the downfall of Tricolor Holdings, saying it was ""not our finest moment."" The bank said Tuesday that it took a $170 million charge-off related to its wholesale lending to Tricolor. ""My antenna goes up when things like that happen,"" Dimon told analysts Tuesday morning. ""I shouldn't say this, but when you see one cockroach, there's probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one,"" he added. A number of analysts asked big banks this week about the risk of their exposure to non-bank financial institutions. That lending category has been the US banking industry's fastest area for loan growth so far this year, according to Federal Reserve data. ""Following the prominent bankruptcies of Tricolor and First Brands, bank investors are rightfully on high alert for any change in asset quality trends,"" KBW analysts wrote in a note. Non-bank lending ""exposures are getting attention, but we believe the way these loans are structured should protect the banks and lead to overall solid credit results,"" Jefferies regional bank analyst David Chiaverini wrote Thursday.

Since the close of trading last week, shares of Rigetti Computing ( RGTI 1.95% ) had risen nearly 10%, as of 11:49 a.m. ET Thursday. The move is being driven by an announcement from JPMorgan Chase earlier in the week. Quantum computing stocks like Rigetti ripped higher earlier this week after JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank by assets in the U.S., announced that it would make $10 billion investment in direct equity and venture capital investments to companies that are part of sectors that enhance national economic security in the U.S. Within its announcement, JPMorgan also cited 27 subareas it would target for investment, and one of them was quantum computing. Image source: Getty Images. ""It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products, and manufacturing -- all of which are essential for our national security,"" JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. The announcement that one of, if not the strongest banks in the country is planning to potentially invest in quantum is a testament to the industry making progress. Investors who managed to purchase shares of Rigetti one year ago are now up over 5,100%, as investors bet big that quantum computing can potentially change society as we know it. Rigetti now has a $16.85 billion market cap and still generates very little revenue. Obviously, the bet is on the tech working and being able to commercialize it, but this still makes Rigetti quite risky if the tech were to not be as strong as expected, or if barriers to commercialization emerge. For this reason, I would only take a very small, speculative position in the stock at most. Invest better with The Motley Fool.

Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com Investment banking fees padded the profits of Wall Street banks in the third quarter like a bed full of thousand-dollar eiderdown pillows. The rebound in mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings so far this year was a big reason why. And, in the contest to capture the unleashed activity, one firm stood tall above all others as if at the top of a financial Olympic podium: Goldman Sachs. There’s more than one reason they didn’t name it Silverman. Thread together buoyant equity markets, long-awaited interest-rate cuts and an administration in Washington committed to lighter regulations and you have a red carpet ready to roll out for a dealmaking revival. That has emerged as one of the key economic stories of 2025, with both mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings rebounding after a years-long slump. Tuesday showed just how Goldman and other banks, which earn fees from advising on and underwriting deals, are benefiting from a period where private equity megadeals, in particular, have taken center stage. There’s the unprecedented $55 billion buyout of video game maker Electronic Arts by a consortium including the Saudi Public Investment Fund, Thoma Bravo’s $10.6 billion acquisition of Boeing’s digital aviation unit, and Blackstone’s $11.5 billion acquisition of utility TXNM Energy, to name just three. Multiple quarterly reports released Tuesday showed the victory spoils divided among Wall Street firms, but Goldman’s investment bankers appear to have drummed up the most business from the rebound: Shares in Goldman, which reported a 37% increase in third-quarter profit to $4.1 billion, fell 2% Tuesday in a volatile session dominated by concerns over a renewed US-China trade standoff. However, the stock is up 34% this year and has outperformed most rivals, including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Bank of America (the latter of which reports today). Dodged a Bullet: Goldman reported a mild credit loss provision of $339 million, less than analysts expected and far less than JPMorgan’s $3.4 billion.
