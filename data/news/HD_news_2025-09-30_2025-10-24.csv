As the market for hydrogen reaches a point of inevitability, his commercial focus and steady leadership will serve Plug well. I’m confident he will guide the company forward with the same integrity and collaboration that have defined his career.” “Jose Luis brings deep knowledge of both our industry and Plug, and the Board is confident he’s the right leader to guide Plug into its next chapter,” said George McNamee, Lead Director, Board of Directors, Plug. “As a veteran leader with unmatched expertise in sales and a clear understanding of our financial goals, Jose Luis ensures continuity in Plug’s strategy and execution.

(NASDAQ:CAPS), a national building products distribution platform, today reaffirmed the success of its disciplined, accretive M&A strategy that continues to strengthen shareholder value. Recent building materials acquisitions by Lowe's and Home Depot validate the sector-wide consolidation thesis that Capstone has been executing - namely, leveraging acquisitions to expand its footprint, scale operations, and drive immediate revenue and EBITDA growth. Capstone has completed four accretive acquisitions to date and recently signed another LOI to acquire a multi-location stone distributor. With its proven integration playbook and financing capacity, the company remains on track to achieve a $100 million annualized revenue run rate by Q1 2026. Key Highlights: Industry Validation: Recent acquisitions by Home Depot and Lowe's show that leading distributors share Capstone's view that consolidation in building products is the path to growth. Proven Outperformance: Bain & Company research shows that building products companies pursuing regular, material acquisitions deliver 3x higher shareholder returns than inactive peers (9.6% vs. 2.7%) . Accretive Track Record : Every Capstone acquisition has been immediately accretive to revenue and EBITDA, reflecting consistent discipline in valuation and post-close execution. Record Growth Trajectory: With multiple transactions closed and an additional LOI underway, Capstone remains on pace toward its $100 million revenue run-rate target. ""We've said from day one that scale in building products is the key to sustainable growth, operational leverage, and a durable competitive moat - and our recent acquisitions are proof of that,"" said Matthew Lipman, CEO of Capstone Holding Corp. ""When Home Depot and Lowe's reinforce that same thesis, it further validates the strategy we've been executing."" Capstone has previously highlighted research from Bain showing that the most successful building products companies use M&A to expand product lines and geographic reach. Many businesses in the sector are too small to pursue this strategy. Capstone is one of the few with the capital structure and experience to scale in a sector that rewards it. To date, Capstone has completed four acquisitions, building a dense distribution network spanning 31 states. Each deal has been immediately accretive and supported record revenue and margin performance in the same year. Two weeks ago, the company announced another LOI with a stone distributor - the latest sign of continued momentum in its acquisition strategy. ""We'll continue to emphasize the value of scale in third-party examples, industry research, and our own results,"" said Matthew Lipman, CEO of Capstone Holding Corp. ""We look forward to sharing more progress on our recently signed LOI and our $100 million run-rate revenue target for Q1 2026."" About Capstone Holding Corp. Capstone Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:CAPS) is a diversified platform of building products businesses focused on distribution, brand ownership, and acquisition. Through its Instone subsidiary, Capstone serves 31 U.S. states, offering proprietary stone veneer, hardscape materials, and modular masonry systems. The company's strategy combines disciplined M&A, operational efficiency, and a growing portfolio of owned brands to build a scalable and durable platform.

Attendees are gathering to discuss how U.S. companies are strengthening energy independence and industrial competitiveness through clean hydrogen and domestic manufacturing. Marsh will participate in the panel “Cracking Down on China — Addressing Risks to American Energy and Supply Chain Security”. The discussion will explore policy and investment strategies that safeguard U.S. manufacturing, reward clean production, and support fair competition in global markets. By combining innovation with strong domestic investment, Plug is proving that the U.S. can compete head-to-head with China, not through subsidies, but through productivity, reliability, and clean-energy excellence. “America’s energy advantage is its competitive edge,” said Marsh. “By turning that power into hydrogen and liquid fuels here at home, we can out-innovate global competitors, secure supply chains, and build a stronger, cleaner economy. I want to thank Senator Cassidy for his leadership in advancing policies that protect U.S. manufacturers and reward environmental accountability.” Plug has identified Louisiana as a strategic hub for its expanding hydrogen network. Earlier this year, Plug and Olin Corporation launched Hidrogenii, a 15-ton-per-day liquid hydrogen joint venture in St. Gabriel, one of the Gulf Coast’s first large-scale hydrogen plants. The facility anchors Plug’s vertically integrated hydrogen ecosystem, serving industrial and mobility customers across the Southeast and Gulf regions. Marsh’s participation underscores Plug’s leadership in building a resilient U.S. hydrogen economy, driving domestic manufacturing, and supporting smart policy measures, such as Senator Cassidy’s Foreign Pollution Fee Act, that create a level playing field for clean, efficient American producers.

Dividend investors, who look for a steady stream of growing income, often gravitate to brands with staying power. Home Depot ( HD +0.55% ) , the largest home improvement retailer, and Nike ( NKE 1.39% ) , a leader in athletic apparel, both fit that description. Additionally, each business throws off cash and returns capital to shareholders, paying dividends for years. Both stocks are having a tough year, so it's a good time to compare them. Which is the better buy today? With the help of a 2.2% increase to its dividend in late February to $2.30 per share, or $9.20 annually, Home Depot's dividend yield currently sits at 2.4%. But what about the underlying business? In its second quarter, sales rose 4.9% year over year. Earnings per share , however, contracted slightly. The key profit figure was $4.58 -- down from $4.60 in the year-ago period. While these figures aren't great, they're not bad for what Home Depot CEO Edward Decker called ""a bit of a frozen housing market."" Eventually, however, the housing market will turn positive. When homebuying and selling, as well as new home starts, finally begin picking up, Home Depot stands to benefit. It could see not only faster sales growth, but also operating margin expansion. Still, even in this tough housing market, Home Depot is guiding for full-year sales growth of 2.8% and an operating margin of 13%. This profitability provides good support for the company's dividend. The company's payout ratio , or its dividend as a percent of earnings, is just 62%. Helping make up for its slow growth during this stagnant housing market, the stock trades at an attractive valuation (26 times earnings as of this writing) for a disciplined market leader. Nike has increased its dividend for 23 consecutive years. The board lifted the quarterly payout to $0.40 ($1.60 annually) last November, an 8% hike. This gives the stock a dividend yield of 2.3%. While Nike 's dividend yield has historically been well supported by strong earnings, the company has faced challenges recently. In fiscal 2025 (ended May 31), revenue declined 10% and earnings per share fell 42% year over year to $2.16 as the company leaned on discounts. That puts Nike's payout ratio around 73% based on last year's earnings -- still solid, but tighter than Home Depot's and more dependent on a rebound. Early fiscal 2026 results (the quarter ended Aug. 31) showed revenue up 1% year over year and earnings per share of $0.49 (down 30%), with gross margin down 3.2 percentage points as the company works through its turnaround. This decline in profitability pushed the company's payout ratio even higher to about 81%. Although Nike is an iconic brand likely to stand the test of time, the company's recent challenges have been significant, making it crucial that its turnaround efforts prove successful. Additionally, shares arguably aren't cheap enough to fully account for the company's challenges and risks -- at least when compared to Home Depot's valuation. Nike currently commands a price-to-earnings multiple of about 35 -- a far richer price tag than Home Depot despite more earnings variability and greater uncertainty. Both companies are high-quality, scaled businesses with long track records of rewarding shareholders. And there are risks for both. A prolonged housing slowdown could weigh on big-ticket projects at Home Depot, while Nike faces margin pressure from discounting, tariffs, and evolving consumer tastes in key markets. Ultimately, over a 10-year horizon, Home Depot looks like a better investment. With Home Depot, investors get a slightly higher yield today, a lower payout ratio that leaves breathing room, and a lower price-to-earnings ratio. Put simply, Home Depot asks less of the future to justify the current dividend and its growth. Nike may very well reaccelerate as its product pipeline and channel strategy regain traction, but the story is more dependent on a major turnaround plan succeeding. For investors choosing between the two for the next decade, Home Depot is probably the better dividend stock to buy and hold. Invest better with The Motley Fool.

Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy . Lisa Su , the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has built one of the world's most valuable companies and made investors billions — but is barely a billionaire herself. She has delivered a 70-fold increase in her company's stock price during her 11 years in charge, including a 41% surge this week to fresh highs thanks to its OpenAI partnership . The chipmaker's market value has soared to $378 billion, surpassing Home Depot, Bank of America, and Procter & Gamble. Yet Su doesn't rank among the world's 500 richest people, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Forbes puts her net worth at $1.5 billion — less than 1% of the $167 billion fortune of her rival and distant cousin, Jensen Huang , the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia. There is one big difference: Huang cofounded Nvidia, while AMD was established in 1969 by a group of engineers who had left Fairchild Semiconductor. One of them, Jerry Sanders , served as CEO until 2002. AMD filings show Su has amassed about 4.7 million shares or a 0.3% stake, worth about $1.1 billion based on the company's stock price ahead of Friday's market open. Her compensation, including salary, bonuses, and stock options, totaled around $31 million last year, per the filings. Su's small ownership stake is the main reason she's not worth more. For comparison, Huang still owns close to a 4% stake in Nvidia, which is worth upward of $160 billion despite significant dilution over the years. Nvidia is also about 12 times larger than AMD, with an unmatched $4.7 trillion market capitalization. Oracle's $847 billion market value is a little over double AMD's figure, but cofounder Larry Ellison owns nearly 41% of the enterprise-software giant — a roughly $350 billion stake that makes him the world's second-wealthiest man after Elon Musk on both Bloomberg and Forbes' rich lists. The difference in size between Su's fortune and theirs underscores that founding a company, and retaining a large stake in it, is the most common path to enormous wealth . Seven of the top 10 people on Bloomberg's list are founders, and another two, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett , shaped their companies, Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway, in their respective images as much as any founder. Steve Ballmer, who joined Microsoft as Bill Gates' assistant in 1980 and later became CEO, is a rare exception because he parlayed a quirk in his contract into a sizable equity stake. AMD stock has almost doubled this year as investors buy into Su's vision of building an AI hardware, software, and services ecosystem. Su isn't likely to crack the top 10 of the rich list soon, but if her shares keep soaring, she could be worth billions more. Jump to",494,en,0.64

HD is skillfully navigating a shifting home improvement landscape by balancing renewed momentum in do-it-yourself (DIY) projects with accelerating growth in its professional (Pro) customer base. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, sales rose 4.9% year over year to $45.3 billion, marking the strongest performance in more than two years. This rebound reflects both resilient consumer demand for smaller-scale home improvement projects and the company’s focus on enhancing the customer experience through technology, supply chain efficiency and faster delivery capabilities. Home Depot’s “Pro acceleration” strategy remains a key growth pillar. The integration of SRS Distribution has exceeded expectations, providing deep access to specialty trade professionals while expanding the company’s presence across roofing, landscape and pool categories. Its pending acquisition of GMS, a leader in drywall and building materials, will further enhance the company’s Pro ecosystem by adding over 1,200 distribution locations and a vast delivery network. These moves strengthen HD’s capacity to serve complex Pro projects and capitalize on a fragmented $1 trillion total addressable market. At the same time, Home Depot is seeing a revival in DIY activity as consumers pivot to smaller, more affordable home projects amid elevated borrowing costs. Categories like storage, paint and seasonal goods posted strong gains, with 12 of 16 departments delivering positive comparable sales. This balanced performance underscores the company’s adaptability, leveraging Pro expansion to offset cyclical softness in big-ticket remodeling while reigniting DIY demand through convenience, innovation and value. Lowe's Companies, Inc. LOW is sharpening its competitive edge by leaning into operational efficiency, Pro customer expansion and disciplined cost control — a strategy designed to close the gap with Home Depot. The retailer continues to streamline its product assortment and optimize inventory through its “Total Home” strategy, which emphasizes complete project solutions for both DIY and Pro customers. While the DIY segment remains soft amid higher interest rates, Lowe’s has made notable strides in the Pro space, growing sales through enhanced job-site delivery, trade credit programs and improved fulfillment capabilities. Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. FND stands out as a high-growth specialist in the hard-surface flooring segment, offering a differentiated model built on value, assortment and Pro engagement. Unlike Home Depot and Lowe’s, FND operates a warehouse-style format that prioritizes direct sourcing and low prices, appealing strongly to both professional installers and value-conscious homeowners. Home Depot shares have declined 7% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 9%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, Home Depot trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 2.28X, higher than the industry’s 1.62X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Home Depot’s current financial-year sales implies year-over-year growth of 2.9%, while the same for earnings per share suggests a decline of 1.4%.

(NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, today announced the completion of the first phase of its hydrogen supply delivery of 44.5 metric tons for H2CAST (Hydrogen Cavern Storage Transition), a joint project led by Gasunie and STORAG ETZEL in Germany. Gasunie is an energy-infrastructure company and operator of gas pipelines in the Netherlands and North West Germany and STORAG ETZEL is the largest independent supplier of cavern storage facilities in Germany. The initiative is repurposing two existing salt caverns into underground storage for renewable hydrogen. Such projects are critical to advancing the energy transition, as salt caverns enable seasonal and high-capacity storage. They provide essential services such as grid balancing and flexibility for renewable energy integration, while ensuring a continuous supply of hydrogen to industrial users. This approach contributes to the development of the broader European hydrogen infrastructure. From April to August, 2025, Plug safely delivered hydrogen to the H2CAST salt cavern, meeting delivery timelines and proving the viability of large-scale hydrogen transport and storage in Germany. Following this successful pilot, Plug was awarded a second delivery mandate for an additional 35 metric tons of hydrogen to the same project H2CAST. Plug will continue to source the hydrogen from Hy2Gen ATLANTIS, the electrolyzer facility in Werlte, Germany, where Plug holds exclusivity on 100% of the green hydrogen produced. “The success of our recent projects in Germany with H2CAST show that hydrogen works, and that it is scalable for strategic national energy requirements,” said Jose Luis Crespo, President and CRO of Plug. “Plug’s ability to deliver hydrogen on time, at volume, and with our own transport and delivery equipment for our customers underscores Plug’s leadership in Europe’s fast-growing hydrogen economy.” Plug’s execution in Germany reflects the company’s broader corporate objective: building unmatched hydrogen production and fleet capacity across the European Union. With a fleet of 36 Multi Element Gas Containers (MEGCs)—rated at 350/380 bar pressure standards —Plug has established a flexible, scalable delivery capability. Plug continues to expand its hydrogen production capacity in Europe, underscoring the market demand for Plug’s vertically-integrated approach to meeting hydrogen customer needs. The H2CAST project expansion also demonstrates Plug’s engineering strength. The company designed a dedicated unloading skid for the facility, developed by its Netherlands-based team, bridging trailer operations directly into the customer’s existing infrastructure. This ability to quickly offer tailored solutions not only ensures seamless delivery, but also enables customers to maximize the commercial value of hydrogen. By delivering green hydrogen production and delivery capacity, Plug is proving that hydrogen is not only viable but ready to play a central role in Europe’s energy mix. These milestones in Germany serve as a cornerstone for Plug’s expanding European operations—reinforcing it as a global industrial gas company and a leading participant in the hydrogen ecosystem worldwide.

A first mover in the industry, Plug provides electrolyzers, liquid hydrogen, fuel cell systems, storage tanks, and fueling infrastructure to industries such as material handling, industrial applications, and energy producers—advancing energy independence and decarbonization at scale.

Amid a partial government shutdown, which began midweek after Congress failed to pass a funding bill, investor optimism was primarily driven by innovations in Artificial Intelligence and increasing hopes for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, the government shutdown has created uncertainties as delays in the release of key economic data have complicated near-term assessments. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index data for September fell sharply by 3.6 points to 94.2, reaching its lowest point since April due to inflation and a weakening job market. The labor market showed some signs of weakening as job openings increased marginally by 19,000 to 7.227 million in August, while hiring decreased by 114,000 to 5.126 million as per the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report. Investors are expecting the Fed to cut interest rates to prioritize the labor market, as the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (Fed's preferred inflation measure) continued to accelerate moderately in line with expectations.

While the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. While these recommendations are determined quantitatively, our analysts have the flexibility to override them for the 1100+ stocks they closely follow based on their better judgment of factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness than the quantitative model.

Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 8.6% Founded and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is a home improvement retailer that sells everything from tools to building materials to appliances. Why Does HD Worry Us? Lagging same-store sales over the past two years suggest it might have to change its pricing and marketing strategy to stimulate demand Gross margin of 33.5% is below its competitors, leaving less money for marketing and promotions 2.4 percentage point decline in its free cash flow margin over the last year reflects the company’s increased investments to defend its market position Home Depot is trading at $392.20 per share, or 25x forward P/E.

Why Do We Think VFC Will Underperform? Constant currency revenue growth has disappointed over the past two years and shows demand was soft Eroding returns on capital from an already low base indicate that management’s recent investments are destroying value 6× net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio shows it’s overleveraged and increases the probability of shareholder dilution if things turn unexpectedly At $14.20 per share, VF Corp trades at 18.2x forward P/E.

Why Are We Out on ICFI? Sales pipeline suggests its future revenue growth won’t meet our standards as its backlog averaged 1.2% declines over the past two years Forecasted revenue decline of 2.3% for the upcoming 12 months implies demand will fall off a cliff ROIC of 8% reflects management’s challenges in identifying attractive investment opportunities ICF International’s stock price of $88.17 implies a valuation ratio of 12.7x forward P/E.

(NASDAQ: PLUG) (“Plug Power” or the “Company”), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy announced that it has entered into a warrant inducement agreement with a single existing institutional investor for the immediate exercise of the entirety of the Company’s outstanding warrants issued in March 2025 (the “Existing Warrants”) to purchase 185,430,464 shares of common stock at the original exercise price of $2.00 per share. The gross proceeds to Plug Power, before deducting estimated transaction expenses and fees, are expected to be approximately $370 million. Upon the immediate exercise in full of the Existing Warrants, the investor will receive (i) 31,000,000 shares of common stock and (ii) in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 154,430,464 shares of its common stock. In consideration of the warrant exercise, the investor will receive new warrants to purchase a total of 185,430,464 shares of common stock (the “New Warrants”).

The offering is expected to close on or about October 9, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.

HD have lost momentum in recent months, pushing it below industry thresholds and portraying a bearish sentiment from a technical standpoint. The Home Depot stock has lost 7.3% in the past month compared with the industry’s decline of 6.8%. As a result, the HD stock slipped below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on Oct. 1. Notably, the stock closed at $397.02 on Oct. 1, 2025, moving below the 50-day SMA of $399.79. Since then, the HD stock has been on a downtrend. HD’s drop below the 50-day SMA signals weakness, suggesting a shift from short-term bullish to bearish sentiment. It highlights fading investor confidence and slower buying interest, especially after months of underperformance. However, the home improvement behemoth trades above its 200-day SMA, indicating improving sentiment toward its long-term fundamentals and market outlook. SMA is an essential tool in technical analysis that helps investors evaluate price trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This approach also provides a clearer perspective on a stock's long-term direction. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Home Depot’s stock shows slowed momentum, with its shares rising 5.9% in the past three months compared with the Zacks Retail – Home Furnishings industry’s growth of 3.4%. Meanwhile, the HD stock has underperformed the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500's growth of 8.5% and 9.4%, respectively. Home Depot’s performance is notably weaker than that of its competitors, Lowe’s Companies Inc. LOW and FGI Industries Ltd. FGI, which have rallied 8.1% and 56.6%, respectively, in the past three months. However, the HD stock has underperformed Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. ’s FND decline of 12.5% in the same period. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research At its current price of $389.33, the Home Depot stock trades 19.3% above its 52-week low mark of $326.31 and 11.4% below its 52-week high mark of $439.37. Home Depot’s slowed momentum reflects a combination of structural and cyclical pressures that are weighing on growth and profitability. The company’s recovery in smaller, non-discretionary projects has yet to offset persistent weakness in large-scale remodels, such as kitchens and bathrooms, segments typically driven by financing availability and consumer confidence. Although big-ticket transactions showed modest improvement, sustained deferrals in larger projects are skewing Home Depot’s sales mix toward lower-margin categories, limiting operating leverage and earnings potential. Margin softness compounds these challenges. Elevated operating expenses, integration costs from the SRS acquisition and tariff-related pressures have eroded profitability despite a stable gross margin. For fiscal 2025, Home Depot expects a flat gross margin of 33.4% and an adjusted operating margin of 13.4%, reflecting continued cost headwinds from logistics, wages and amortization. Currency fluctuations and tariffs further constrain flexibility, while reduced promotion risks weaken demand in price-sensitive areas. Inventory levels also rose $1.8 billion year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2025 amid tepid big-ticket demand, heightening markdown risks. With management projecting just 1% comparable sales (comps) growth and a 2% decline in adjusted EPS for fiscal 2025, the near-term outlook remains cautious. Until macro conditions and renovation demand stabilize, Home Depot’s earnings recovery is likely to remain muted. Home Depot’s fundamentals continue to signal long-term strength, supported by steady sales growth, strategic investments and deepening customer engagement. In second-quarter fiscal 2025, sales rose 4.9% year over year, driven by broad-based category gains and a 1% comps increase. The company’s ability to grow average ticket size underscores its pricing power and strong demand for premium products. Its integrated retail model, blending digital convenience with in-store expertise, remains a key differentiator, with online comps rising 12% year over year. Ongoing investments in supply-chain efficiency, AI-enabled logistics and delivery speed are enhancing customer satisfaction and strengthening operational resilience. Additionally, Home Depot’s focus on expanding its Pro ecosystem through acquisitions like SRS and GMS boosts its presence in higher-value, recurring projects. With a disciplined expansion strategy and a robust omnichannel foundation, Home Depot is well-positioned to sustain market leadership and drive consistent long-term growth despite near-term macro headwinds. HD currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 2.29X, which positions it at a premium compared with the industry’s average of 1.65X. However, the stock is trading slightly below its median P/E level of 2.36X observed in the past year. This premium positioning is especially notable when compared with peers like Lowe’s (with a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 1.54X), Floor & Decor (1.53X) and FGI Industries (0.09X). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Home Depot’s fiscal 2025 EPS has held steady at $15.03, implying a year-over-year decline of 1.4%. Meanwhile, the EPS estimate for fiscal 2026 has declined 0.4% to $16.30, suggesting year-over-year growth of 8.5%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research HD’s recent slip below its 50-day simple moving average signals near-term weakness and fading investor confidence, reflecting a pause in momentum. The move below this key technical level often suggests a shift in sentiment, raising concerns about the stock’s short-term direction. Slower price appreciation compared with the broader market and industry peers further underscores investor caution amid soft margins and muted remodeling demand. However, the company’s fundamentals continue to point to long-term resilience. Trading above its 200-day average and backed by a strong balance sheet, digital leadership and growing Pro customer engagement, Home Depot remains well-positioned to capitalize on secular trends in home improvement. Investments in supply-chain modernization, AI-driven logistics and omnichannel capabilities provide a solid footing for sustained growth. While near-term volatility may persist, the company’s market dominance and execution strength suggest enduring value for long-term investors. Home Depot currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By investing in technology to enhance productivity, building out its Pro ecosystem to address complex customer needs and improving delivery speed for every customer, HD looks to reinforce its position and gain market share. Meanwhile, acquisitions like SRS and GMS deepen Pro relationships and broaden specialty capabilities. The $18.25-billion SRS Distribution acquisition bolsters the company’s relationships with professional contractors. SRS is a major distributor in the residential specialty trade, catering to professional roofers, landscapers and pool contractors. SRS has become a key growth driver, enabling cross-selling opportunities and expanding the company’s Pro-focused product range. On the other hand, Home Depot’s $5.5 billion acquisition of GMS marks a significant advancement in its efforts to build a comprehensive Pro distribution ecosystem. GMS brings strong operational capabilities, an extensive distribution network and long-standing customer relationships, further positioning the business as a full-service partner for Pro contractors. This will bolster HD’s organic efforts to serve Pros on complex projects with a wider assortment of interior building products and services and expand fulfillment capabilities. HD’s GMS acquisition is likely to add a highly complementary adjacent vertical to SRS' business with diverse capabilities, product categories and customer relationships, alongside expanding SRS' distribution footprint across the US and Canada. SRS will have a network of more than 1,200 locations and a sales operation of more than 3,500 associates. On its last earnings call, management cited that it has an additional 400 nodes of distribution to add to SRS’ network of 800. Both acquisitions are designed to provide a competitive edge and position the company for long-term success in the Pro segment. Lowe's Companies, Inc. LOW and Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. FND are the key companies competing with Home Depot. Lowe’s is solidifying its Pro market leadership through the acquisitions of Artisan Design Group and Foundation Building Materials, broadening its presence in the professional market. As a core part of its Total Home strategy, Lowe’s continues to make investments in modernizing its network to boost its omnichannel capabilities. Strong operating momentum, disciplined cash flow and AI-driven initiatives are enhancing productivity and customer engagement. Balanced growth in Pro and DIY segments, supported by digital transformation and partnerships, underpins long-term potential. Floor & Decor, together with its subsidiaries, is a high-growth, differentiated, multi-channel specialty retailer of hard surface flooring and related accessories and seller of commercial surfaces. The company also focuses on professional and commercial growth through specific programs, financial tools like credit solutions, and dedicated events like ""PRO Appreciation Month. Floor & Decor's efforts for professionals include the PRO Premier Rewards program for discounts and loyalty points, design and other support services. Shares of Home Depot have gained 0.6% year to date against the industry’s decline of 4.9%.

HD is transforming its fulfillment model from a traditional retail network into an interconnected ecosystem that seamlessly links stores, digital platforms and job sites. In its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call, management highlighted that stores remain the “center of the ecosystem,” acting as both customer hubs and fulfillment nodes. The company’s machine learning-driven “ship from best location” system determines the most efficient delivery route, enabling record-breaking same-day and next-day speeds. These investments are paying off as customers using faster delivery options are spending more frequently both in-store and online. To support this surge in demand, Home Depot has added Order Fulfillment Associates across stores and enhanced their mobile tools to prioritize and batch-pick orders. These upgrades have improved accuracy and reduced turnaround times, driving higher satisfaction. The company is also optimizing freight flow, improving shelf availability and deploying a sophisticated order management system that allows modifications, jobsite deliveries and invoicing upon receipt. These features are crucial for professional contractors managing complex projects. Home Depot’s fulfillment reinvention extends beyond logistics to ecosystem expansion. The integration of SRS and the planned acquisition of GMS will create a vast distribution network spanning more than a thousand locations and thousands of delivery vehicles. Together, these assets will deepen Home Depot’s reach into specialty trades, offering a broader product mix and faster site-to-store service. By blending physical scale, technology and Pro-focused capabilities, Home Depot is redefining home improvement fulfillment for the digital era. Lowe’s Companies Inc. LOW and Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. FND are intensifying their push to modernize fulfillment, deploying new technologies and distribution models to close the gap with Home Depot in the race for faster, more efficient delivery and customer convenience. Lowe’s is reshaping its fulfillment model through the acquisition of Foundation Building Materials (“FBM”), a move designed to strengthen its Total Home strategy and accelerate Pro customer growth. By integrating FBM’s 370-branch network and advanced logistics, Lowe’s can deliver faster, more efficient job site fulfillment, particularly in high-density regions like California and the Northeast. The acquisition also brings cutting-edge tools such as the myFBM mobile app and AI Blueprint Takeoff technology, enhancing order accuracy, delivery tracking, and speed for both large and mid-sized Pro customers. Floor & Decor is expanding its fulfillment reach by blending warehouse efficiency with customer-focused innovation. The retailer’s growing network of 257 warehouse-format stores and five design studios acts as both sales and distribution hubs, enabling faster delivery of in-stock flooring and installation products. Its multi-channel model integrates e-commerce and in-store fulfillment, ensuring pros and homeowners receive on-time, reliable access to materials for renovation and construction projects. Home Depot’s shares have lost 8.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 12.8%.

Home furnishing and improvement retailers understand that ‘home is where the heart is’ but that a home is only right when it’s in livable condition and furnished just right. These stores therefore focus on providing what is needed for both the upkeep of a house as well as what is desired for the aesthetics of a home. Decades ago, it was thought that furniture and home improvement would resist e-commerce because of the logistical challenges of shipping a sofa or lawn mower, but now you can buy both online; so just like other retailers, these stores need to adapt to new realities and consumer behaviors. The 7 home furnishing and improvement retail stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues along with next quarter’s revenue guidance were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 12.7% since the latest earnings results. Founded and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is a home improvement retailer that sells everything from tools to building materials to appliances. Home Depot reported revenues of $45.28 billion, up 4.9% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and EPS in line with analysts’ estimates. ""Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The momentum that began in the back half of last year continued throughout the first half as customers engaged more broadly in smaller home improvement projects,"" said Ted Decker, chair, president and CEO. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 4.7% since reporting and currently trades at $375.99. Read our full report on Home Depot here, it’s free for active Edge members . With an aesthetic that features natural materials such as reclaimed wood, Arhaus (NASDAQ:ARHS) is a high-end furniture retailer that sells everything from sofas to rugs to bookcases. Arhaus reported revenues of $358.4 million, up 15.7% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 7.4%. The business had an exceptional quarter with EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts’ expectations and a beat of analysts’ EPS estimates. Arhaus achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. However, the results were likely priced into the stock as it’s traded sideways since reporting. Shares currently sit at $9.79. Is now the time to buy Arhaus? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free for active Edge members . Known for mattresses that can be adjusted with regards to firmness, Sleep Number (NASDAQ:SNBR) manufactures and sells its own brand of bedding products such as mattresses, bed frames, and pillows. Sleep Number reported revenues of $327.9 million, down 19.7% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 8.3%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts’ revenue and EPS estimates. Sleep Number delivered the highest full-year guidance raise but had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. As expected, the stock is down 27.7% since the results and currently trades at $5.90. Read our full analysis of Sleep Number’s results here. Formerly known as Restoration Hardware, RH (NYSE:RH) is a specialty retailer that exclusively sells its own brand of high-end furniture and home decor. RH reported revenues of $899.2 million, up 8.4% year on year. This print met analysts’ expectations. Aside from that, it was a slower quarter as it recorded a miss of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations.

Started in 1956 as a store specializing in French cookware, Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is a specialty retailer of higher-end kitchenware, home goods, and furniture. Williams-Sonoma reported revenues of $1.84 billion, up 2.7% year on year. This result was in line with analysts’ expectations. It was a very strong quarter as it also produced an impressive beat of analysts’ gross margin estimates and a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.

Thanks to the Fed’s series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth.

While major clients like Home Depot, Walt Disney Imagineering, and now Red Sea Global are adopting Adobe's enterprise AI solutions, the news does not materially change the biggest near-term catalyst: accelerated enterprise AI adoption.

Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog: The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc., The Boeing Co. and The Progressive Corp., as well as two micro-cap stocks Frequency Electronics, Inc. and United Bancorp, Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

The company's strong second-quarter fiscal 2025 results and broad-based sales growth. Comps improved, driven by higher-value purchases and steady demand from both Pro and DIY customers. HD continues to advance its ""One Home Depot"" strategy, enhancing the interconnected shopping experience through faster delivery, expanded fulfillment centers, and digital innovation. Online sales rose sharply, reflecting investments in AI, logistics, and personalization. Meanwhile, acquisitions like SRS and GMS deepen Pro relationships and broaden specialty capabilities. However, HD faces softer demand in big-ticket discretionary categories, reflecting consumer caution amid high interest rates. Margin pressure, currency headwinds, tariffs woes and macroeconomic uncertainty also remain key risks. (You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>> ) Shares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+36.5% vs. +16.6%). The company remains the largest U.S. commercial aircraft manufacturer. Steadily growing commercial air travel should boost Boeing's service business unit. Our model also reflects that. The outlook for Boeing's defense and space business segment also remains optimistic. The acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems should strengthen Boeing's long-term revenue prospects. However, the shortage of labor continues to pose a threat to this aircraft giant. Trade tensions between the United States and China may cause Boeing to be unsuccessful in the timely delivery of its 737 jets and thereby hurt its operational performance. Supply-chain issues and heightened U.S. import tariffs also pose a threat to this stock. (You can read the full research report on Boeing here >>> ) Progressive's shares have underperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (-9.3% vs. +2.8%). The company continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio and strength in Personal auto, contributing about 75% of total premiums. Rate increases, personal auto application increases, improving retention rates and a strong independent agents' network should drive long-term premium growth and generate steady revenues. Investment in digital transformation should support this strength. Progressive has a reinsurance program to offset some of its losses and a strong financial position overall. All these positives have led to the overvaluation of its shares, the main factor keeping us on the sidelines. A non-conducive geopolitical landscape and macro uncertainties could reduce demand for autos, having a corresponding negative impact on its growth prospects. (You can read the full research report on Progressive here >>> ) Shares of Frequency Electronics have outperformed the Zacks Instruments - Control industry over the year-to-date period (+93.6% vs. +11.5%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $350.78 million offers strong near-term revenue visibility with a $71 million funded backlog, 64% expected to convert within 12 months, supported by stable demand from government and aerospace sectors. Recent defense wins, including a $3.1 million Patriot Missile contract, underscore the strategic relevance of its proprietary oscillators and clocks. The company maintains solid liquidity with $29.6 million in working capital and positive cash flow, enabling continued R&D investment and share repurchases. Expansion into emerging technologies and vertical integration enhances product differentiation and supply chain resilience. However, key risks include Q1 FY26 revenue and margin declines due to program delays and early-stage contract mix, rising SG&A tied to growth initiatives, high U.S. government exposure, and increased inventories. Shares are up 94.3% YTD, trading at premium EV/sales and EV/EBITDA multiples. (You can read the full research report on Frequency Electronics here >>> ) United Bancorp's shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry over the year-to-date period (+5.2% vs. -3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $76.79 million offers stable earnings growth supported by strategic investments and prudent capital management. Q2 2025 net income rose 10% YoY to $1.9 million, driven by higher net interest income and a stronger margin (3.65%). Despite higher costs from new initiatives like the Wheeling Banking Center and Unified Mortgage Division, these are expected to drive long-term asset and fee growth. Dividend increases (8.2% YTD) and a 5.2% forward yield enhance shareholder returns. Asset growth (+3.2%) and capital strength (8.9% of average assets) support future expansion. However, risks include margin compression from rising deposit costs, a growing unrealized loss on long-duration securities ($17.7 million), and rising nonperforming loans. Operating expenses are rising due to structural investments, pressuring efficiency. The stock trades at a discount to peers (P/E 10.47x vs.10.85x sub-industry).

The following year, the stock rose a bit faster, to $158.40, with Home Depot boasting more than $100 billion in sales for the fiscal year 2017. In 2018 and 2019, the stock continued to climb, reaching $209.07 in September 2018 and $233.98 in 2019. The stock then experienced an even more significant surge in 2020, reaching $285.58 in September, largely due to COVID-19’s impact on home remodeling and more. The fourth quarter of 2020 was a great time for Home Depot, as its sales increased by $6.5 billion, or 25.1% from the year before, to $32.3 billion. Most people found themselves stuck in their homes, and many were working from home for the first time, which created a large demand for home improvement projects . This trend continued, with the stock price reaching $333.37 in September 2021. However, as people began going back to work and COVID-19 regulations eased up in 2022, the stock dropped back down slightly, falling to $271.54 in September 2022. Since that time, though, HD has rebounded. On Sept. 15, 2023, the stock bounced back to $321.40 per share. On the same day a year later, it rose to $379.99, beating the boost it received from the COVID-19 era. Currently, Home Depot is a strong stock, with analysts projecting a high price target of $481.

For investors to be comfortable holding Home Depot stock, they need to believe in the company’s ability to deliver steady growth through investments in supply chain modernization, expansion of its Pro customer base, and technology enhancements. The recent focus on reverse logistics and operational efficiency, highlighted at the CSCMP EDGE conference, reinforces management’s long-term strategy but does not materially affect the key short-term catalyst, an uptick in discretionary renovation demand, or the biggest risk: prolonged weakness in big-ticket projects due to economic uncertainty. One timely announcement closely related to this conference is Home Depot’s continued investment in its Pro ecosystem, including the integration of SRS Distribution and the pending GMS acquisition. These moves directly support the company’s strategy to grow professional sales, which could help offset near-term softness in consumer renovation spending and align with management’s focus on higher-value, resilient revenue streams. On the other hand, investors should be mindful of persistent customer deferment of large renovation projects, as ongoing economic headwinds could result in...

Investors seem to be weighing recent performance against long-term growth prospects, especially after a modest pullback over the past month. See our latest analysis for Home Depot. Home Depot’s share price has seen some modest volatility over the past few weeks. However, the bigger picture suggests momentum has slowed compared to its notable strength over the last few years. The recent 1-year total shareholder return is just slightly negative, while the 3-year return remains firmly positive. This shift may reflect investors pausing to reassess Home Depot’s long-term growth story and valuation after such a strong run, especially as the broader retail landscape faces new headwinds. If you’re curious about what’s next in retail, consider expanding your search and discover See the full list for free. With shares pulling back from their highs but the company maintaining steady earnings growth, the key question emerges: does Home Depot’s recent dip offer investors an attractive entry point, or is future growth already fully reflected in the price? Home Depot’s widely followed narrative points to a fair value comfortably above its last close of $389.33. This suggests the current price does not reflect the growth potential many expect. Analyst forecasts remain firm, but what is truly driving this valuation is a blend of digital transformation, Pro expansion, and shifting industry demands. Home Depot's sizable investments in advanced supply chain technologies, machine learning-based delivery optimization, and in-store digital enhancements are yielding faster delivery, higher customer satisfaction, and improved operational productivity. These trends are expected to boost net margins and drive long-term earnings growth. Read the complete narrative.
