Get prepared with the key expectations.,"The market expects Terex (TEX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 30, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. This machinery products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.4%. Revenues are expected to be $1.4 billion, up 15.5% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.06% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). For Terex, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.27%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination indicates that Terex will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Terex would post earnings of $1.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.49, delivering a surprise of +3.47%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times. An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Terex appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Among the stocks in the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, Caterpillar (CAT), is soon expected to post earnings of $4.52 per share for the quarter ended September 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -12.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $16.75 billion, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Caterpillar has been revised 0.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of +1.44%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate. When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Caterpillar will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

Revenues are forecasted to be $16.75 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 4%. Over the last 30 days, there has been a downward revision of 0.4% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe. Ahead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock. While it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights. That said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Caterpillar metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor. The average prediction of analysts places 'Total sales and revenues- Machinery, Energy & Transportation- All Other' at $105.69 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +14.9%.

IoT in Construction Market Dublin, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""IoT in Construction Market - Global Forecast 2025-2032"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Internet of Things (IoT) in Construction Market is witnessing transformative growth propelled by advancements in digital connectivity, resulting in enhanced project delivery, safety, resource optimization, and sustainable practices. With an impressive growth trajectory from USD 17.77 billion in 2024 to an estimated USD 69.95 billion by 2032, the sector demonstrates an evolution of traditional workflows into agile, intelligent processes. Industry stakeholders can leverage the integration of IoT to refine strategic planning, competitive advantage, and risk mitigation efforts, thereby positioning themselves for leadership in a burgeoning market. Transforming Construction Operations with IoT Digital connectivity through IoT solutions is revolutionizing the construction industry by linking equipment, wearable devices, and environmental sensors. These innovations offer real-time tracking, predictive alerts, and automated safety monitoring that streamline decision-making and mitigate risks. As a result, early adopters are experiencing improved schedule adherence and enhanced worker safety. Integrating such next-generation technologies allows construction firms to deliver projects efficiently while focusing on safety and sustainability.

This makes the dividend yield 5.1%, which is above the industry average. Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Caxton and CTP Publishers and Printers was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth. Over the next year, EPS could expand by 22.5% if recent trends continue. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 33%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend. See our latest analysis for Caxton and CTP Publishers and Printers The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was ZAR0.65, compared to the most recent full-year payment of ZAR0.70. Its dividends have grown at less than 1% per annum over this time frame. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past. With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. It's encouraging to see that Caxton and CTP Publishers and Printers has been growing its earnings per share at 22% a year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that Caxton and CTP Publishers and Printers could prove to be a strong dividend payer. In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock. Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

CAT has inked an agreement to acquire RPMGlobal Holdings Limited for a total equity value of AUD 1.12 billion ($732 million). With RPMGlobal’s long-standing expertise in providing data-driven software solutions for every stage of the mining lifecycle, it will strengthen CAT’s current capabilities and help its mining customers operate with greater efficiency. RPMGlobal Holdings is an Australian-based provider of mining software solutions. The addition of RPMGlobal Holdings’ software solutions is expected to enhance Caterpillar's existing technology in asset and fleet management, and autonomy. The acquisition will further benefit from RPMGlobal Holdings’ agile approach and culture to developing solutions and Caterpillar's customer-centric focus. The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026. The closing of the transaction is subject to approval by RPMGlobal shareholders and other closing conditions. In recent years, miners have been increasingly relying on technology to increase productivity, reduce costs and improve frontline safety. Caterpillar has been expanding its autonomous capabilities and investing in advanced products and technologies to tap into this growing demand. CAT reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.72 for the second quarter of 2025, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.88 by 3.3%.

Caterpillar reported revenues of $16.57 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.35 billion by 1.3%. The top line dipped 1% year over year as unfavorable price realization of $414 million offset higher sales volume of $237 million. Higher sales volume was mainly driven by increased sales of equipment to end users. CAT witnessed revenue declines of 2% in North America, 4% in Latin America and 2% in the Asia Pacific. EAME was the only bright spot, delivering 6% growth. On a positive note, Caterpillar reported record sequential backlog growth of $2.5 billion in the quarter.

For more information please view the Barchart Disclosure Policy here Share Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT ) is a leading global industrial firm specializing in construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural-gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and related services, headquartered in Irving, Texas. Caterpillar’s scale and market presence are reflected in a market cap of around $234.4 billion . This industrial giant is expected to announce its fiscal third-quarter 2025 earnings soon. Ahead of this event, analysts expect the company to report a profit of $4.56 per share , down 11.8% from $5.17 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has missed Wall Street’s bottom-line estimates in three of the past four quarters, while surpassing on one occasion. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect CAT to report an EPS of $17.89, down 18.3% year-over-year from a profit per share of $21.90 in fiscal 2024 . However, in FY2026, the company’s EPS is expected to rebound, increasing 18% annually to $21.11.

Caterpillar’s stock has gained momentum amid strong demand signals, especially from energy and data-center infrastructure projects . The company is increasingly seen as benefiting from the artificial intelligence (AI) and data center boom; its power generation and energy segments are expected to see tailwinds. Also, lower interest rates make financing big equipment purchases more affordable , which tends to boost demand for heavy machinery, improving investor sentiments. On Oct. 8, CAT shares rose 4% after multiple firms raised their price targets, citing strong profit margins, a $35 billion backlog, and steady demand supported by favorable economic trends. Wall Street analysts are moderately bullish about CAT’s stock, with a “ Moderate Buy ” rating overall. Among 22 analysts covering the stock, 12 recommend “Strong Buy,” nine suggest a “Hold,” and one advice a “Moderate Sell” rating. While CAT currently trades above its mean price target of $465.53, the Street-high target of $582 indicates a potential upswing of 16.3% from the current market price.",371,en,0.64

The company is capturing attention with new partnerships to deliver large-scale power solutions for data center growth. See our latest analysis for Caterpillar. Momentum around Caterpillar has picked up, with the stock rallying over 22% in the last month alone and 50% year-to-date, as investor excitement grows over its deepening involvement in AI infrastructure and smart power solutions. While headline acquisitions like the RPMGlobal deal add buzz, the real story is a shift in sentiment reflecting Caterpillar’s evolution. Its one-year total shareholder return stands at an impressive 39%, underscoring both strong execution and a bullish long-term outlook. If Caterpillar's leap into AI-powered infrastructure has sparked your interest, it could be the perfect moment to scan the market for other high-growth innovators. See the full list of opportunities via See the full list for free. With shares soaring to all-time highs, the real question for investors now is whether Caterpillar is undervalued amid the AI infrastructure rush, or if the market has already priced in years of future growth. Caterpillar’s narrative fair value sits well below the recent closing price, indicating that a premium is being placed on the shares. This creates an opportunity to examine the assumptions behind this change in valuation. Record backlog growth across all three primary segments, driven by strong global infrastructure demand (particularly in North America, Africa, and the Middle East), positions Caterpillar for above-trend sales growth in late 2025 and into 2026.

Singaporean Construction Equipment Market Research Report 2025-2030 Dublin, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Singapore Construction Equipment Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Singapore's construction equipment market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.09% from 2024 to 2030. KEY HIGHLIGHTS Earthmoving equipment accounted for the largest market share in the construction equipment market in 2024. Excavators in the earthmoving segment accounted for the largest share in 2024. The country's investment in developing its public infrastructure drives the growth of the Singapore earthmoving market. On the other hand, demand for material handling equipment is also growing due to the booming manufacturing sector, driving the development of warehouses and logistics parks across the country. In 2024, Singapore announced plans to build a second airport logistics park from 2030 to increase the capacity of the existing park and boost Changi Airport's role as a regional air cargo hub. In 2024, the earthmoving segment accounted for a significant share of Singapore's construction equipment market; the segment is estimated to reach 2 thousand units by 2030. The road construction equipment segment is estimated to surpass USD 14 million by value by 2030. Road roller sales are high in Singapore in response to the rising renovation and expansion of transport networks. In 2024, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) awarded a contract to Quek and Quek Civil Engineering Pte Ltd for the construction of a new vehicular flyover at PIE/ Jurong Canal Dr, including an at-grade road connecting Jurong Canal Dr with Tengah Blvd. Construction equipment utilization in the construction industry by end-user (volume) has the largest market share in 2024. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) projects the total construction demand, i.e., the value of construction contracts to be awarded, to range between $36.5 billion and $41.2 billion in nominal terms in 2025. Amid the ongoing tariff uncertainties and trade tensions in 2025, business sentiments in the manufacturing sector remain largely cautious in Singapore. Meanwhile, the electronics segment remains optimistic, with the semiconductor industry anticipating a seasonal pick-up in orders as well as sustained strength in AI-related demand in 2025. Growing semiconductor chip demand in Singapore is driving the development of chip manufacturing plants, thereby driving the sales for material handling equipment (forklifts, cranes, telescopic handlers). SINGAPORE CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT MARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS Rising Demand for Electric Construction Equipment Singapore is gradually adopting electric construction equipment, primarily driven by rising concerns about environmental safety to reduce carbon emissions. Singapore has set ambitious targets to enable sustainability across the building and construction value chain through its Singapore Green Building Masterplan (SGBMP), launched in February 2025. This includes introducing mandatory sustainable construction practices. Construction equipment manufacturers are making continuous investments in launching battery-powered equipment in the Southeast Asian market, including Singapore. Increasing Demand for Smart and Autonomous Construction Equipment Smart construction equipment features technologies like GPS, telematics, and automated controls. These tools improve accuracy and shorten task completion time. This leads to lower operating costs, fewer delays, and better resource management. Komatsu Ltd. made a significant technological advancement in 2024 by incorporating artificial intelligence into its Smart Construction Edge platform. The latest version of Komatsu Smart Construction Edge leverages advanced AI to automatically remove obstacles - such as equipment and structures - from drone survey data. With increasing labor shortage in the country and high labor cost, the demand for smart construction equipment is expected to rise to optimize the construction costs. Increased Construction Activities In 2024, about 80% of the demand was driven by building work, which included key projects such as new Built-To-Order (BTO) units, polyclinics with nursing homes, foundation works for Eastern Integrated Health Campus and Alexandra Hospital redevelopment, and various private residential and mixed/integrated developments. Meanwhile, the private sector is forecast to generate between $10.8 billion and $23.3 billion in demand in 2025, with major contributions from the planned expansion of Marina Bay Sands, the recommencement of delayed commercial and hospitality developments, and upcoming data center projects. Therefore, Singapore's construction industry is experiencing remarkable growth, fueled by government initiatives and a surge in urban development. This growth is expected to support the demand for the construction equipment industry over the forecast period. Rising Development of Semiconductor Chip Manufacturing Plants and Data Center Projects According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), this growth momentum of 2024 is expected to continue into 2025, with market projections reaching approximately $697 billion (a 11% year-over-year increase). This expansion will be attributed to rising demand for high-performance computing, memory, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies. In August 2025, Singapore's semiconductor maker Frencken announced it to invest $63 million to build a new five-storey manufacturing facility in Kaki Bukit. The facility will be built on a land area of 12,318 sq m, and construction began in Q3 2025 and is expected to be completed by Q1 2027. Singapore's ongoing expansion of the data center and semiconductor manufacturing facilities is projected to drive demand for construction equipment throughout the forecast period. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS Slowdown in the Economy Due to Global Volatility in Trade and Impact of US Tariffs In April 2025, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) significantly lowered the country's 2025 GDP growth projection from a previous 1-3% to 0-2%. All of Singapore's export-oriented industries - particularly manufacturing - have been severely affected by this slowdown. For instance, electronics sector activity in Q1 2025 grew much more slowly than in the previous quarter. Singapore is also indirectly impacted by the tariffs. China and other countries rely on the intermediate goods and services it exports for their own shipments to the United States. When key trading partners such as the US and China face tariffs or weaker demand, Singapore's tightly integrated economy sees corresponding declines or contractions. Therefore, fluctuations in the baseline tariffs for Singapore are expected to slow down the country's industrial and construction growth, which will directly impact the demand in the construction equipment industry over the forecast period. Increasing Construction Costs in Singapore Due to the rising cost of construction, Singapore property developers are not intending to bid aggressively for upcoming land sales in 2025, impacted by elevated construction costs, tighter margins, and a surplus of unsold homes. According to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), more than 20,400 private residential units, including executive condominiums, remained unsold in the second quarter of 2025, and the Building and Construction Authority expects construction costs to rise by as much as 2% in 2025. In Singapore, construction spending weakened by 0.4% in June 2025 and fell 2.9% compared to last year. Therefore, rising construction costs in Singapore are likely to have several implications on the construction of residential and public infrastructure, which will further reduce the demand for construction equipment over the forecast period.

Caterpillar’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago when the stock gained 3.3% on the news that investors scooped up equities, shaking off the initial concerns inferred from the Fed's dot plot, with tech stocks leading the charge. As a reminder, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points the previous day and signaled that more reductions could come before year-end and beyond. Initially when the cut was announced and Fed Chair Powell held his press conference, there was a pullback in the market as the Fed's ""dot plot"" revealed that only one cut was likely for 2026. This was below the three cuts that had been priced into the markets. This was the first interest rate cut of 2025, a move investors had widely anticipated. In response to the decision, stocks rose significantly, positioning major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to open at record levels. The Fed's decision was influenced by signs of a weakening labor market. Lower interest rates are generally seen as positive for stocks because they reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make fixed-income investments like bonds less attractive by comparison, driving capital into the equity market. While Fed Chair Powell noted the path forward has risks, the prospect of looser monetary policy has fueled optimism on Wall Street. Caterpillar is up 40.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $505.34 per share, has set a new 52-week high.

As AI’s soaring electricity demands fuel growth in power infrastructure, investors are increasingly eyeing Caterpillar's high-margin turbine and power-generation business, propelling CAT stock to record highs. The shift highlights how Wall Street’s AI enthusiasm is expanding beyond chipmakers and cloud giants to industrial firms powering the AI economy. As demand for reliable, resilient power scales with AI and cloud computing, Caterpillar might just be the dividend stock ready to be the next AI “power play.” Caterpillar is a leading global industrial firm specializing in construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural-gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and related services. Headquartered in Irving, Texas, Caterpillar’s scale and market presence are reflected in its market capitalization of roughly $230.2 billion. CAT stock has delivered a standout performance so far this year, rising ahead of many benchmarks as investor sentiment has swelled around its expanding role in AI infrastructure and power generation. Shares have demonstrated solid momentum over the past month, surging by 16% and hitting a fresh high of $511.50 on Oct. 10 , while propelling year-to-date (YTD) gains to 35%. The rally appears to be driven in part by optimism that Caterpillar’s turbines and power systems will become vital components of AI data centers — a hidden growth engine beyond its legacy construction and mining business. CAT stock is up by 24% over the past 52 weeks. CAT stock currently trades at 27.9 times forward earnings, a premium valuation compared to the sector median and its historical average. Caterpillar is also widely viewed as a reliable dividend payer, boasting a streak of 31 consecutive years of dividend increases. Earlier this year, the board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.51 per share, marking a 7% increase . This brings its annualized dividend to about $6.04, translating to a yield of 1.21%. Caterpillar’s payout ratio is modest at 28.95%, underscoring that the dividend is well covered by earnings and leaving headroom for future increases. While yields aren’t unusually high, the consistency, growth track record, and low payout ratio make the firm's dividend appealing to income-oriented investors seeking durability. Caterpillar is increasingly positioning itself as more than just a manufacturer of heavy machinery. Indeed, it’s becoming a foundational player in AI infrastructure through its power generation, energy storage, and autonomous technologies. A prime example is the firm's agreement with Joule Capital Partners and Wheeler Machinery to deliver 4 gigawatts of power capacity for a 4,000-acre data center campus in Utah planned for 2026. This project will use Caterpillar’s G3520K generator sets, combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) systems, and 1.1 gigawatt-hours of grid-forming battery storage, allowing the campus to reliably power AI workloads and even reuse waste heat to help cool servers. Further, Caterpillar has entered a long-term strategic partnership with Hunt Energy to deliver up to 1 gigawatt of power generation capacity for data centers in North America, beginning with a project in Texas. This move reinforces Caterpillar’s footing in meeting the demands of AI facilities, emphasizing reliability, uptime, and performance. Thus, Caterpillar is not just riding the AI wave — it’s building much of the power and reliability infrastructure that AI needs. Caterpillar announced its second-quarter 2025 results on Aug. 5, reporting an adjusted profit per share of $4.72 , down from $5.99 in Q2 2024. Total revenues came in at $16.6 billion, representing a 1% year-over-year (YOY) decline, largely driven by “unfavorable price realization” of $414 million, partially offset by higher volume of $237 million. Adjusted operating margin narrowed to 17.6%, from 22.4 % a year ago, reflecting cost pressures and tariffs. On the cash front, Caterpillar generated $3.1 billion in enterprise operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash. The company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For guidance, Caterpillar now expects full-year 2025 revenues to grow slightly over 2024, revising prior flat expectations upward. Analysts predict EPS to be around $17.80 for fiscal 2025 , down 19% YOY, before surging by 18% annually to $21.06 in fiscal 2026. Recently, Erste Group analyst Hans Engel upgraded Caterpillar from “Hold” to “Buy.” Engel cited the firm's above-average operating margins, high return on equity, and expected significant earnings growth over the next year, driven by robust incoming orders, especially in the energy systems segment. In September, BofA Securities also upgraded its price target for Caterpillar to $517 from $495 while maintaining a “Buy” rating, highlighting the company’s Solar Turbines unit as a “hidden gem” with high margins and strong growth potential in power, energy, and data-center applications. Wall Street is moderately bullish on CAT stock. Overall, CAT has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating . Of the 22 analysts covering the stock, 12 advise a “Strong Buy,” nine analysts are on the sidelines with a “Hold” rating, and one gives a “Moderate Sell.” While CAT is trading at a premium to its mean price target of $470.79, the Street-high target price of $582 suggests that the stock could rally 18% from here.",908,en,0.4

This adjustment reflects a blend of optimism about the company’s strong operating momentum and measured caution regarding ongoing industry challenges such as tariffs and global trade developments. Readers interested in understanding how Caterpillar’s story continues to evolve should stay tuned for guidance on tracking these critical updates moving forward. Recent analyst commentary on Caterpillar captures a dynamic spectrum of opinions as Wall Street weighs the company’s strong operating performance against persistent external pressures. Updated research and company guidance have prompted a blend of optimistic upgrades and renewed caution, with varying implications for Caterpillar’s stock valuation. 🐂 Bullish Takeaways Several analysts, including JP Morgan’s Michael Hall, have raised price targets in response to Caterpillar’s sustained operating discipline and cost management. Notably, Hall revised his target to $485, which underscores market confidence in management’s execution. Robust demand in the energy systems segment and high return on equity relative to industry peers have contributed to analyst optimism for earnings growth over the next year. There are expectations for improved cycle momentum through 2026. Bullish research notes point to Caterpillar’s ability to maintain strong margins and effective dealer inventory control despite tariff costs. Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley believe this adds to the company’s execution quality and transparency. While upside potential is seen as somewhat priced in, especially after recent gains, analysts generally believe that trough earnings forecasted for 2025 set the stage for healthier volume growth. This outlook is bolstered by factors like anticipated rate cuts and sector-specific tax policies. 🐻 Bearish Takeaways Some firms, such as UBS, have issued more cautious notes, lowering their price target to $450 and warning that updated tariff exposures present downside risk for the company’s 2025 and 2026 net earnings projections. Bearish analysts cite sector-wide caution, emphasizing that new steel and aluminum tariffs add ongoing cost pressure, not just for Caterpillar but across all major equipment manufacturers. Downward price revisions by Citi and others reflect concerns about slowing global trade, commodity price volatility, and the risk that recent valuation improvements leave less room for near-term upside. The need to closely monitor global macroeconomic trends and international trade policy changes remains a recurring theme among those with a more cautious outlook on Caterpillar’s future performance.

Head to the Simply Wall St Community to discover more perspectives or begin writing your own Narrative! The U.S. government has voiced concern following Norway’s sovereign wealth fund decision to divest from Caterpillar on ethical grounds. The divestment is connected to how Caterpillar equipment is reportedly used in conflict zones. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, one of the world’s largest institutional investors, announced it would sell its stake in Caterpillar, citing ongoing concerns about potential involvement in human rights violations related to the company’s products in conflict areas. MarketWatch reports that Caterpillar may be the ""mystery stock"" speculated to have been acquired by Berkshire Hathaway. Observers see this as a sign that Caterpillar could become a major infrastructure bet for Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle.

Charles Payne Says Do This Instead Find Out: 7 Tax Loopholes the Rich Use To Pay Less and Build More Wealth If you’re building a portfolio today, these are five stocks — plus one wildcard — that you might seriously regret not owning before the next year rolls around. Current share price : $450 Price target : $507 (Yahoo Finance) Caterpillar has long been synonymous with heavy equipment, but its importance goes far beyond bulldozers and excavators. As countries ramp up spending on infrastructure, energy projects and mining, Caterpillar is often the first beneficiary. The company has shown strength even amid supply chain pressures, and it continues to ride the wave of industrial sector growth. Yes, tariffs and global demand fluctuations can dent margins in the short term, but Caterpillar’s global presence and strong brand give it pricing power. Investors who buy today are positioning themselves for both dividend income and exposure to massive infrastructure investments that are expected to define the next several years. Read Next: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell Current share price : $473 Price target : $480 Defense may not be glamorous, but it’s one of the most dependable sectors in the market . Lockheed Martin has a decades-long track record of delivering for shareholders, with a dividend yield close to 3% and consistent annual increases. The company is a cornerstone of U.S. defense spending, producing fighter jets, missile defense systems and space technology that are critical to national security. In a world marked by geopolitical uncertainty, demand for Lockheed’s products isn’t going anywhere. While defense budgets are subject to politics, Lockheed’s long-term contracts provide stability and visibility into future revenues. For investors looking for a blend of income and resilience, this is a stock that could provide peace of mind all the way through 2026 and beyond. Current share price : $363 Price target : $397 While it doesn’t grab headlines like Tesla or Nvidia, Eaton plays a quiet but crucial role in the global shift toward electrification. The company specializes in power management, such as electrical components, energy-efficient systems and solutions for modernizing the grid. With the world moving rapidly toward renewable energy, electric vehicles and smarter infrastructure, Eaton sits at the intersection of several megatrends. Its steady demand profile makes it less volatile than other industrials, and its dividend adds income to the growth story. The risks lie in input costs and broader economic slowdowns, but Eaton’s role in building resilient energy systems makes it a stock that could deliver quietly compounding returns for years. Current share price : $751 Price target : $888.64 Axon, formerly known as Taser International, has transformed itself into one of the most exciting growth stories in the industrial-tech space. While its stun devices remain a core product, Axon has built a fast-growing ecosystem of body cameras, cloud-based digital evidence management and public safety software. Its recurring revenue model — with annual recurring revenue growing north of 30% year-over-year — shows that its products are sticky and essential for law enforcement agencies. The stock isn’t cheap, and investors will need to stomach volatility if growth expectations wobble. But Axon has raised revenue guidance consistently, proving that demand is only accelerating. For those who want a slice of high-growth industrial innovation, Axon is a name you’ll likely regret overlooking. Current share price : $301 Price target : $384 Oracle may not be the first company that comes to mind when you think of cutting-edge tech, but its evolution into a cloud and AI player is paying off. Long a staple in enterprise software and databases, Oracle has been aggressively building its cloud infrastructure business. It also pays a steady dividend, recently set at $0.50 per share, offering investors some income alongside potential growth. Competition from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google is fierce, but Oracle’s legacy customer base and ongoing shift to the cloud give it a durable foundation. And recent projections show up to 14x growth over the next 5 years in cloud alone. If enterprise AI adoption accelerates — as most analysts expect — Oracle could enjoy a resurgence that makes today’s share price look like a bargain in hindsight. Every portfolio needs a little spice, and Coinbase is exactly that . As one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, its fortunes rise and fall with the crypto market. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major headwind, and revenues are still highly tied to trading activity. But here’s the flip side: If crypto adoption continues to expand, with institutional investors piling in and governments clarifying rules, Coinbase could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Beyond trading, the company is also leaning into custodial services and blockchain infrastructure, which could provide more stable revenue streams. For risk-tolerant investors, ignoring Coinbase could mean missing out on one of the decade’s biggest potential growth stories.

With Q2 behind us, let’s have a look at Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and its peers. Automation that increases efficiencies and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new sales opportunities for construction machinery companies. On the other hand, construction machinery companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the commercial and residential construction that drives demand for these companies’ offerings. The 4 construction machinery stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.5%. Thankfully, share prices of the companies have been resilient as they are up 5.9% on average since the latest earnings results. With its iconic yellow machinery working on construction sites, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) manufactures construction equipment like bulldozers, excavators, and parts and maintenance services. Caterpillar reported revenues of $16.57 billion, flat year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.2%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a slower quarter for the company with a significant miss of analysts’ EPS and EBITDA estimates. ""The Caterpillar team remained focused on customer success and demonstrated solid operational performance this quarter,"" said CEO Joe Creed. Interestingly, the stock is up 15.6% since reporting and currently trades at $501.41. Read our full report on Caterpillar here, it’s free for active Edge members . Inventing the first ever double-barrel hot-mix asphalt plant, Astec (NASDAQ:ASTE) provides machines and equipment for building roads, processing raw materials, and producing concrete.

Aside from that, it was a satisfactory quarter as it also logged an impressive beat of analysts’ revenue estimates but full-year EBITDA guidance missing analysts’ expectations.

Thanks to the Fed’s series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth.

Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Caterpillar (CAT). Caterpillar currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.99, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.99 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy, representing 52.2% of all recommendations. Check price target & stock forecast for Caterpillar here>>> The ABR suggests buying Caterpillar, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations. This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them. On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks. Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements. In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Caterpillar, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.1% over the past month to $17.91. Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Caterpillar.

This upward revision follows new attention from analysts, some of whom see stronger-than-expected operating results and signs of robust order flow ahead. Stay tuned to discover how you can keep track of evolving analyst perspectives as Caterpillar’s story continues to unfold. Recent analyst commentary on Caterpillar reflects a broad range of opinions regarding the company’s valuation, quality of execution, and growth outlook. Below, we break down the most notable bullish and bearish takeaways from major Wall Street firms. 🐂 Bullish Takeaways Baird raised its price target on Caterpillar to $540 from $495, designating the shares as a bullish “Fresh Pick” and signaling expectations for a breakout. Bernstein increased its price target to $502 from $447, citing expectations that Caterpillar will modestly surpass third-quarter estimates and set up for a strong finish heading into 2026. Truist raised its price target to $507 from $414, underscoring Caterpillar’s operational strength in both sales and segment profit, even as tariff costs remain elevated. The firm also noted continued healthy dealer inventory management. Citi lifted its target to $500 from $460, expressing greater confidence that 2025 marks a trough for earnings, with room for improvement ahead. Erste Group upgraded Caterpillar to Buy from Hold, highlighting above-average operating margins, industry-leading return on equity, and the prospect of significant earnings growth, especially in the energy systems segment. Evercore ISI upgraded Caterpillar to Outperform and maintains a $476 price target, citing resilient construction equipment margins, volume leverage, and benefits from stabilizing inventory levels in North America. Bullish analysts continue to reward Caterpillar’s consistent execution, disciplined cost control, and transparent communication about operational headwinds. Growth momentum, particularly in key segments and geographies, remains a notable driver. However, even some bullish voices caution that much of the upside may already be priced in. This suggests that further gains could require new catalysts. 🐻 Bearish Takeaways RBC Capital initiated coverage with a Sector Perform rating and a $560 price target, acknowledging Caterpillar’s strong positioning but noting that current expectations are sufficiently reflected in today’s valuation. The firm remains on the sidelines and is awaiting a more attractive entry point. Morgan Stanley lowered its price target to $350 and reiterates an Underweight rating after raising concerns about increased tariff headwinds. The firm reduced its 2025 earnings estimate to $17.13, below consensus, and warned that the updated tariff regime could pose risks for Caterpillar and industry peers. JPMorgan reduced its target to $505 from $520 while maintaining an Overweight stance. The lower estimate reflects the sizable impact from new tariff announcements and a downward revision in near-term profit forecasts. Jefferies, while maintaining a Buy rating and a $500 target, acknowledged tariff-related headwinds for Caterpillar and other heavy manufacturers. This prompted downward revisions to current estimates even as long-term cycle upside persists. Barclays raised its price target to $485 from $425, but maintains an Equal Weight rating due to ongoing inventory adjustments. The firm suggests opportunities may exist in relative laggards rather than Caterpillar itself. Bearish and more cautious analysts focus on the near-term risks stemming from higher input costs, ongoing tariff pressures, and concerns that Caterpillar’s valuation fully prices in the current growth outlook. Sizable price target reductions and rating downgrades from firms like Morgan Stanley and outlooks from RBC Capital underscore a view that investors may want to wait for better entry points or further clarity before getting more constructive. Do your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts? Perhaps you think there's more to the story. Head to the Simply Wall St Community to discover more perspectives or begin writing your own Narrative! The U.S. government has raised concerns following Norway's sovereign wealth fund decision to divest from Caterpillar. This move was driven by ethical objections over the company’s products being used in conflict areas and has led to diplomatic discussions between the U.S. and Norway. Norway’s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund publicly confirmed the sale of its entire holding in Caterpillar, citing potential risks of contributing to human rights violations in war zones as the reason behind the exit. MarketWatch reports that speculation is mounting around Caterpillar as the most likely candidate for Warren Buffett’s previously undisclosed $5 billion industrial stock investment. This has sparked ongoing rumors about a possible major new shareholder. Consensus Fair Value Estimate has risen by about $30, moving from $468 to $498 per share. Discount Rate has decreased slightly, now at 8.47 percent compared to 8.48 percent previously. Revenue Growth projection has increased modestly from 5.59 percent to 5.67 percent. Net Profit Margin is nearly unchanged, with a slight decrease from 18.22 percent to 18.08 percent. Future P/E Ratio has climbed from 18.88x to 20.21x. This reflects a higher expected valuation multiple going forward. A Narrative is a smarter way to invest, connecting the story behind a company to its forecasts and fair value.

Caterpillar Inc.'s share was trading at $527.47 as of October 14th. CAT’s trailing and forward P/E were 24.98 and 23.20 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. Christian Lagerek/Shutterstock.com Caterpillar, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives, with a rich history dating back to 1925 and headquarters in Irving, Texas. The company is widely recognized for its strong brand, reliable products, and low total cost of ownership, earning it a Morningstar-assigned wide economic moat and a bullish value proposition rating. Caterpillar has demonstrated consistent profitability, with double-digit net margins and high gross margins, supported by strong cost management and brand loyalty, though recent revenue growth of -4.9% lagged the S&P 500’s broader gains. Its management has delivered impressive returns on equity, exceeding 40% and aligning with market leaders, aided by strategic capital allocation, including a $21.8 billion share buyback announced in June 2024. Returns on invested capital have modestly exceeded the company’s weighted average cost of capital, indicating efficient deployment of shareholder funds. Over the trailing five years, Caterpillar’s owners’ earnings—reflecting EPS growth plus dividend growth—have achieved positive double-digit annualized returns, underscoring the company’s ability to generate durable shareholder value. While revenue growth has been challenged by cyclical market conditions, Caterpillar’s strong brand, loyal customer base, and leading positions in construction machinery and heavy equipment provide resilience and long-term growth potential. With solid margins, robust cash generation, and ongoing capital return programs, the company remains well-positioned for continued wealth creation. These factors, combined with a proven management team and strategic capital allocation, make Caterpillar a compelling investment for long-term oriented investors, offering a balance of current cash flow yield and potential upside through disciplined operational execution and shareholder-friendly actions. Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Terex Corporation (TEX) by Value Don’t Lie in February 2025, which highlighted the ESG acquisition, cyclical troughs in its Materials Processing and Aerial Work Platforms segments, and potential multiple expansion as leverage declines. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 19% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as Terex’s diversification and trough-level valuation support upside. David J. Waldron shares a similar bullish perspective on Caterpillar Inc. but emphasizes its wide economic moat, strong margins, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation.
