The move aims to accelerate cost savings to 3 billion Swiss francs by 2027, up from a previous 2.5 billion target, and restore investor confidence after months of leadership turmoil. Shares surged 8 percent following the announcement. Navratil, who replaced Laurent Freixe in September after his dismissal, said 12,000 white-collar roles will be eliminated over two years, with another 4,000 jobs cut in manufacturing and supply chain functions. The cuts are part of an efficiency drive to boost profitability as Nestle faces rising costs, U.S. import tariffs, and slowing consumer demand. The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, with 4.3 percent organic sales growth and a 1.5 percent increase in real internal growth, driven by strong performance in coffee and confectionery. Analysts at Bernstein called the job cuts a “significant surprise” that adds “fuel to the turnaround fire.” Nestle maintained its 2025 guidance, forecasting improved organic sales growth and an operating profit margin at or above 16 percent. Strategic reviews are underway for its water, premium beverage, and vitamins divisions. Navratil said his focus is on building a performance-driven culture and reigniting growth through innovation and efficiency. CFO Anna Manz noted that Nestle will consolidate its Chinese operations to rebuild consumer demand after overextending distribution. The company expects most cost savings to materialize between 2026 and 2027.",241,en,0.92

The reductions include 12,000 management positions and 4,000 roles in production and supply chain operations. The company expects these measures to reduce its cost base by 1 billion Swiss francs by 2027, although implementation costs are projected to be about double that amount. The restructuring expands on the existing 'Fuel for Growth' initiative launched under Navratil’s predecessors, which had targeted 2.5 billion francs in savings, including 500 million from white-collar positions. With Navratil’s plan, the total savings goal has risen to 3 billion francs. In its nine-month results, Nestlé reported sales of 65.9 billion francs, down from 67.15 billion a year earlier. The company said the cuts aim to streamline operations and strengthen profitability amid a challenging consumer environment and cost pressures.",155,en,0.86

The announcement, made alongside nine-month financial results showing sales down 1.9 percent to 65.9 billion francs, sent Nestlé shares soaring more than 8 percent. Navratil said the company “needs to change faster,” emphasizing a focus on efficiency and renewed growth. Nestlé, whose brands include Nespresso, KitKat, Maggi, and Perrier, has faced management turmoil in recent months, with its former CEO dismissed in September and its chairman stepping down early. Despite headline sales declines driven partly by currency effects, organic sales rose 3.3 percent in the first nine months of 2025, fueled by price increases of 2.8 percent and strong performance in coffee and confectionery. Analysts welcomed the stronger-than-expected volume growth of 1.5 percent in the third quarter and viewed the restructuring as a critical step toward stabilizing the company. Navratil said the turnaround plan marks the beginning of a faster, performance-driven transformation to restore Nestlé’s growth momentum.",216,en,0.78
