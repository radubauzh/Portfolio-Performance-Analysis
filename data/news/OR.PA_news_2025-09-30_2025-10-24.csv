The deal marks the first major move by new Kering CEO Luca de Meo and L’Oreal’s largest acquisition to date, surpassing 2023’s 2.5 billion dollar Aesop purchase. Kering has agreed to sell its beauty business to L’Oreal for 4 billion euros (4.7 billion dollars), as de Meo aims to cut the group’s debt and refocus operations. L’Oreal will acquire Kering’s fragrance brand Creed and obtain exclusive 50-year licences to develop beauty products for Kering’s fashion labels including Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga. The sale reverses former CEO François-Henri Pinault’s strategy, who had acquired Creed in 2023 for 3.5 billion euros. Analysts called the transaction a pragmatic step, allowing Kering to reduce its 9.5 billion euro net debt, while L’Oreal strengthens its position in luxury fragrances. Kering’s shares rose 4.8 percent and L’Oreal’s 1.2 percent after the announcement. The agreement also grants L’Oreal a 50-year Gucci licence once Kering’s existing deal with Coty expires, expected around 2028. De Meo signalled that more divestments could follow, focusing Kering on businesses where it has scale and expertise. Kering’s beauty division, created in 2023, had posted a 60 million euro operating loss in the first half of the year amid weaker Gucci sales, especially in China. The sale helps alleviate pressure from slowing growth and high leverage. Kering has already delayed a full takeover of Valentino and plans to monetise parts of its real estate portfolio. For L’Oreal, the acquisition broadens its luxury portfolio alongside Yves Saint Laurent, whose rights it bought from Kering in 2008. Experts described the 4 billion euro price as justified, giving L’Oreal access to prestigious but underdeveloped brands and limited competition for the asset. Kering was advised by Evercore and Centerview, while L’Oreal worked with Bank of America and Rothschild. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026.",510,en,0.92
