The deal — similar to a pact announced last week by Pfizer Inc . — will see AstraZeneca slash what it charges for its medicines in exchange for three years of relief from threatened tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The company will launch all of its new medicines in the US at the lowest prices offered to peer countries, as well as provide the company’s medicines to the Medicaid health insurance programme for low-income and disabled people at steeply discounted prices. “You’re going to pay whatever the lowest price anywhere in the world is,” Trump said. The British drugmaker will expand the number of products sold through its direct-to-consumer website, AstraZeneca Direct at what Trump described as “heavily reduced” cost, and make those medicines available on the TrumpRx website once it launches. The deal is the latest in what Trump administration officials say are a series of voluntary measures drugmakers are implementing to stave off more draconian moves by the government. Over the summer, Trump sent letters to 17 of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies with a list of demands. They included lower prices for the Medicaid insurance program for low-income and disabled people, direct sales of discounted drugs to patients and the introduction of newly approved medicines at the same prices in the US as in other developed countries. A pact with the British pharmaceutical powerhouse advances the Trump administration’s efforts and may lure other companies to the negotiating table. Soriot broke ranks with his peers in the industry in July, saying the US should pay similar prices for newly developed drugs as other wealthy countries. The financial implications of the deal remain unclear. The tariff threat for AstraZeneca is somewhat contained because it makes most of the medicine it sells in the US domestically. In September, Astra launched a new direct-to-consumer platform, where patients can get the diabetes drug Farxiga and the asthma inhaler Airsupra for as much as 70 per cent off their list prices. Drugs expected to see price cuts under the Trump deal include Airsupra, Farxiga, and COPD medicine Bevespi, according to a chart displayed at the event. Farxiga was Astra’s best-selling drug last year with $7.7 billion in sales, but prices were already set to come down as part of the Medicare drug price negotiation programme for 2026. Soriot was with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz on Thursday in Virginia, where the company is expanding its US manufacturing as part of its $50-billion investment in the US. “We have more coming, but this is a very important one,” Oz said on Friday in the Oval Office, suggesting additional drug companies are likely to announce similar deals soon. Trump has called on drugmakers to make more of their medicines in the country, and the administration has launched an investigation into whether the lack of local production is a national security threat. Americans have traditionally paid the highest prices in the world for drugs. The structure positioned the US at the epicenter of a multibillion dollar market that generated scores of breakthrough medicines. It also allowed wealthy countries in Europe and elsewhere to draft off of American investment and reap the benefits without paying an equivalent share of the cost. The Trump administration has vowed to change the calculus through a concept known as most-favoured nation pricing. It would require companies to offer their drugs in the US at prices that are equivalent or lower than those in other countries. Investors initially feared that tariffs and rules around drug pricing would be a significant blow to the bottom line for pharmaceutical companies. As the deals have rolled out, Wall Street has interpreted drugmakers’ commitments as having less of a financial impact than originally anticipated.

But Is the Pharmaceutical Giant a Buy?,The uncertainty about U.S. pharmaceutical tariffs shouldn't be as worrisome for AstraZeneca now.,"AstraZeneca's shares jumped after Pfizer's announcement of a major deal with the Trump administration. Pfizer's good news could benefit AstraZeneca, too. 10 stocks we like better than AstraZeneca Plc › Shares of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN) have jumped more than 10% this week. On Monday, the British drugmaker reported positive results from a clinical study of Enhertu in treating HER2-positive early breast cancer. However, the main reason for AstraZeneca's big gain was Pfizer 's (NYSE: PFE) announcement of a deal with the Trump administration. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla appeared with President Donald Trump at a press conference on Tuesday to announce the landmark agreement. Pfizer plans to slash the prices on many of its prescription drugs in the U.S. and invest $70 billion in expanding its domestic operations. It will also participate in a new TrumpRx website that will help consumers find medications at discounted prices. In return, Pfizer will enjoy a three-year grace period during which it won't be affected by the Trump administration's tariffs on pharmaceutical imports to the U.S. Good news for Pfizer could be good news for AstraZeneca, for two reasons. First, President Trump hinted in the press conference earlier this week that other deals similar to Pfizer's could be on the way. As the fourth-largest pharmaceutical company based on market cap , AstraZeneca is likely to be among the drugmakers lining up to follow in Pfizer's footsteps. Second, like Pfizer, AstraZeneca already has plans to expand in the U.S. CEO Pascal Soriot said in the company's 2025 first-half update, ""As we enter our next phase of growth, we have pledged $50 billion to continue to grow in the U.S., which includes the largest manufacturing investment in AstraZeneca's history, set for Virginia."" The bottom line is that the chances seem to be pretty good that his company will be able to secure an exemption from tariffs over the next three years, as Pfizer has. Some of the uncertainty that was hovering over the entire biopharmaceutical industry, including AstraZeneca, has now been lifted. Is the stock a buy? Maybe so. For one thing, it is priced reasonably with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 15, and it continues to deliver strong earnings growth. The company is also making great strides with its pipeline, announcing more than a dozen positive results from late-stage clinical studies in recent months. I think AstraZeneca should be able to deliver solid gains for long-term investors. It's not the best pharma stock on the market, in my view, but it's still a pretty good one.

AstraZeneca saw its share prices jump to a new all-time high on Wednesday, as investors cheered reports that President Donald Trump delayed the imposition of a 100-percent tariff on all pharmaceutical imports. A report by Politico quoting a White House official said that Trump delayed the imposition of drug levies, set to take effect today, October 1, as the US government negotiates drug pricing with pharmaceutical giants. Following the news, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) soared to its highest 52-week price of $84.61 before trimming gains to end the day just up by 9.96 percent at $84.36 apiece. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) rallied alongside its counterparts in the US and Europe, helped by Pfizer Inc.’s landmark deal with the US government to lower drug prices for Americans and make them at par with prices in other key developing countries. Analysts said they expected drugmakers to follow suit in return for lower tariffs on their drugs entering the US. “We expect EU pharma to follow suit and negotiate with the Trump administration for exemptions,” Lucy Coutts, investment director at wealth managers JM Finn, was quoted as saying in a report by Reuters. JPMorgan also said that it expects the Pfizer deal to become the bellwether for other drug companies in their negotiation strategies.

Like what you see? You can subscribe here. There is an old British saying about buses: you wait ages for one and then two arrive at once. Pharmaceuticals analysts experienced something similar on Monday as the big two U.K. drugmakers — GSK and AstraZeneca — delivered major announcements. GSK said Emma Walmsley, its CEO of nine years, who steered it through its demerger (its former consumer healthcare arm is now a separate company called Haleon), will leave at the end of the year. Her successor is Luke Miels, currently chief commercial officer, was poached from AZ amid acrimony eight years ago. AZ, meanwhile, announced plans to ""harmonise its share listing structure to deliver a global listing for global investors in a global company"". In practice, that means delisting its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) from the Nasdaq, replacing them with a direct listing of ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange. ADRs are tradable certificates issued by U.S. banks representing a specific number of shares (usually one) of a foreign company. They tend to be less liquid than fully listed stocks — and that deters some investors. The move was welcomed by investors, with shares up 0.8% on Monday. It should bring in new U.S. investors, especially if — although this is not a given — AZ eventually gains membership of the S&P 500. At first blush, it confirms fears first aired when, in July, The Times reported that CEO Pascal Soriot wanted to move AZ's stock market listing to the U.S. The British newspaper said Soriot, who today marks 13 years at the helm, had spoken privately of doing this on several occasions and had even discussed moving AZ's domicile. Soriot fanned the flames when, at subsequent results briefings, he did not deny the report and even called AZ a ""very American company."" AZ is among several big pharma companies to recently pause or postpone U.K. investments amid frustration at the country's drug-pricing regime. Accordingly, some interpret this as another blow to the London Stock Exchange (LSE), which is indeed how it was reported locally. A clutch of big names, all former FTSE 100 members, have moved their primary listing away from the U.K. lately. The defections began when, in 2021, BHP Group (previously BHP Billiton) — at the time the FTSE's most valuable company — announced plans to switch from a dual-listed structure, in which its shares were listed in both the U.K. and Australia, to a single primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). This was essentially a cost-saving and simplification exercise and few alarm bells rang at the time, not least because BHP retained a standard listing on the LSE, allowing British investors to remain exposed to the business. Moreover, BHP had no real assets in the U.K., other than a head office. The following year, the plumbing and heating products distributor Ferguson — a U.K. stock market stalwart for decades under its former name of Wolseley — moved its primary listing to New York. Again, this was no surprise, since North America by then accounted for more than 90% of its sales. There was still no panic when, in March 2023, CRH — the world's biggest building materials supplier — chose to switch to New York. After all, having only had a primary listing in London for 12 years, CRH was essentially an Irish company generating more than three-quarters of its earnings in the U.S. There was more disquiet when Flutter Entertainment, owner of successful betting and gaming businesses such as Paddy Power, Betfair, Sky Betting & Gaming and the U.S. business FanDuel, said it was considering moving its main listing to New York. It has since done so. This was altogether more serious as Flutter, the Irish-founded Paddy Power aside, was essentially British and a big player in its domestic market. Compounding concerns, later that year, the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm Holdings opted to list on Nasdaq instead of the LSE on its return to the stock market. Since then, the Anglo-German tour operator TUI has moved from a dual listing in London and Frankfurt to a single one in the latter, while the FTSE 100 plant and equipment hire company Ashtead — named after the Surrey village where it was founded — has announced plans to move its primary listing from London to New York. This again reflects the fact that 90% of its business is now in North America. The bad news, like the London drizzle, has kept on coming: Just Eat Takeaway said last December it would move from a dual listing in London and Amsterdam to a single one in the latter; the same location was chosen in February this year by Unilever for its demerged ice cream business. Fast-fashion giant Shein was recently reported to have chosen Hong Kong over London for its forthcoming Initial Public Offering, and Wise (formerly Transferwise), a fintech founded in London by two Estonian entrepreneurs and now valued at more than £11 billion ($14.78 billion), received shareholder approval in July to move its primary listing from London to New York. AZ's decision, though, may not be as bad as it looks. It was at pains to stress its ""current status as a U.K. listed, headquartered and tax resident company"" would not change and that this was all about attracting a broader mix of global investors and better access to New York's larger pools of capital. Nor does this look to be a move in search of a higher stock rating: AZ's price-to-earnings ratio exceeds not only those of European peers like Novo Nordisk and Roche, but also several U.S. peers including Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck. The British government should not get complacent, however. This move potentially eases a full switch of listing to New York should Soriot's frustrations at the U.K. finally boil over. Rachel Reeves, the country's chancellor, could prove she is alert to the risk posed to the London market by removing Stamp Duty Reserve Tax, the anachronistic levy of 0.5% applied on all share purchases. But — as it raises £3 billion annually for the Treasury — I wouldn't bet on this. Louise Hellem, chief economist at the CBI, discusses the Chancellor's options ahead of the U.K. government's upcoming Budget at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool.

The administration will be issuing guidance to allow employers to offer fertility perks as excepted benefits, a category that includes supplemental health coverage like dental and vision. The guidance will allow employers to offer add-on coverage at a fixed cost for patients and employers. The White House previously issued an executive order directing the administration to produce by May policy recommendations aimed at lowering the cost of expensive fertility treatments. The report never came. Now, five months later, it’s addressing the technology that can cost upwards of $15,000 per procedure. The “result will be healthier pregnancies, healthier babies and many more beautiful American children,” Trump said at a press conference from the Oval Office on Thursday. Fertility was a frequent theme on the campaign trail for Trump, who once called himself the “father of IVF” at a town hall. But it’s a sticking point for some of his conservative base, particularly after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that frozen embryos could be considered children. Some fertility clinics suspended treatment until the Republican governor signed legislation protecting providers from liability. “Endorsing IVF from the White House podium should have some positive impact on awareness and adoption for IVF, even if there are no actual financial benefits being provided to employers to adopt those benefits,” wrote Michael Cherny, an analyst at Leerink Partners, in a note to investors. Trump has been taking steps to lower health care prices. He struck deals with Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc to delay threatened tariffs on their medicines in exchange for charging the same in the US as they do abroad. The pharmaceutical companies also agreed to cut the prices they offer to the Medicaid health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

This premarket","🔴 See All Market Updates Live → U.S. equity futures are showing a strong rebound this Monday, October 13, 2025, signaling a positive start to the week for the stock market. This premarket surge comes after President Donald Trump adopted a more conciliatory tone regarding trade relations with China over the weekend, easing investor anxieties that had led to a significant market downturn on Friday. The optimistic sentiment is driving futures higher across the board, with particular strength seen in technology and chipmaker stocks. Premarket Trading and Futures Movements As of Monday morning, U.S. stock futures are rallying robustly. Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) futures are up approximately 0.9% to 1.44%, while S&P 500 ( SPX ) futures have climbed between 1.2% and 1.43%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) futures are leading the charge, advancing significantly by 1.4% to 2.69%. This positive momentum follows a challenging end to last week, where renewed U.S.-China trade tensions triggered a sharp sell-off across major indexes. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY ) and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ( QQQ ), which track the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 respectively, are also showing considerable gains in premarket trading. The shift in market sentiment is largely attributed to President Trump 's remarks, wherein he stated, ""Don't worry about China, it will all be fine,"" suggesting a de-escalation of trade rhetoric. This has provided a much-needed boost after Friday's session saw the S&P 500 experience its worst day since April, plummeting 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite ( IXIC ) recording its biggest single-day decline since April 10, falling 3.6%. The Dow Jones also slid 1.9% on Friday, contributing to weekly declines across all three major indexes. Current Performance of Major Market Indexes While Monday's trading is just beginning, the premarket activity suggests a strong recovery from Friday's losses. On Friday, October 10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 45,479.60, the S&P 500 at 6,552.51, and the Nasdaq Composite at 22,204.43. The broader U.S. stock market index (US500) has already seen gains, rising to 6638 points on October 13, a 1.30% increase from the previous session, and is up 13.27% over the past year. This performance indicates that despite recent volatility, the underlying market trend remains upward-biased over the longer term. The bond market is closed today in observance of Columbus Day, which is also recognized in some areas as Indigenous Peoples' Day. However, the 10-year Treasury bond yielded 4.03% and the two-year bond was at 3.50% at the end of last week. In commodities, crude oil futures are trading higher, hovering around $60.04 per barrel, while Gold Spot U.S. Dollar has risen 1.32% to approximately $4,071.30 per ounce, nearing its all-time record high. The U.S. Dollar Index spot is slightly higher at 99.1160. Upcoming Market Events The week ahead is packed with critical events that could significantly influence market direction. The ongoing U.S. government shutdown remains a key concern, as it threatens to delay the release of crucial economic data, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), and retail sales figures. Despite the shutdown, some economic indicators are still expected. Investors will be watching for the NAHB Housing Market Index on Thursday, and Industrial Production, Building Permits, Housing Starts, Nonfarm Payrolls, and the Unemployment Rate on Friday. Earnings season officially kicks off this week, with major financial institutions set to report their third-quarter results. This will provide vital insights into corporate health and economic trends. Key earnings releases include: On the monetary policy front, markets are currently pricing in a 96.2% likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its upcoming October meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak on Tuesday, which could offer further clues on the central bank's outlook. Internationally, China's September trade figures, released today, showed exports surging 8.3% year-over-year and imports growing 7.4%, indicating resilience despite global trade tensions. Other international data to watch includes UK GDP and Eurozone Industrial Production. Major Stock News Today's premarket rally is broad-based, with several prominent companies making headlines.

In other corporate news, shares of MP Materials ( MP ), a key player in rare earth minerals, surged 10% in premarket trading, while USA Rare Earth ( USAR ) also saw gains, benefiting from the easing of U.S.-China trade tensions after China had tightened rare-earth export controls. Cryptocurrency-related stocks, including Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ), MARA Holdings ( MARA ), Coinbase Global ( COIN ), and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), are also on the rise as Bitcoin ( BTC ) rebounded over 3% to trade around $115,212.40 per coin. Conversely, Levi Strauss & Co. ( LEVI ) shares plunged 12.6% after the company warned that U.S. government tariffs would negatively impact its fourth-quarter margins. QUALCOMM Inc. ( QCOM ) also saw its shares drop 7.3% following news that China has initiated an antitrust investigation into its acquisition of Israel's Autotalks. Applied Digital Corp. ( APLD ) bucked the trend, with its shares jumping 16.1% after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $64.22 million.

JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) was up about 1% in premarket trading after announcing a $10 billion investment in sectors critical for national security. Overall, Monday, October 13, 2025, is shaping up to be a day of recovery and anticipation, with premarket gains driven by a softening in U.S.-China trade rhetoric and investors keenly awaiting the start of the Q3 earnings season.

This morning's rally aims to recoup significant losses from Friday, which saw major indexes tumble amidst renewed tariff threats. The positive sentiment is also buoyed by expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts, even as an ongoing government shutdown continues to cast a shadow over economic data releases. Premarket trading indicates a robust rebound across the board. S&P 500 ( SPX ) futures are up approximately 1.2% to 1.5%, while Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) futures are surging, gaining between 1.6% and 2.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) futures are also showing strong upward momentum, climbing 0.7% to 1.12%. This significant premarket strength is largely attributed to President Donald Trump 's conciliatory remarks over the weekend, which eased fears of an escalating trade war with China after he had threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese imports on Friday. The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants are leading the charge in premarket trading. Nvidia ( NVDA ) is up 3.7%, Tesla ( TSLA ) has gained 2.8%, and Microsoft ( MSFT ) advanced 1.5%. Meta Platforms ( META ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) are also seeing gains, both rising 1.6%. In the commodities market, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trending higher, hovering near $59.76 per barrel, up around 1.4% to 1.6%. Gold prices are also rallying strongly, setting a new peak and rising around 0.8% to 1.3%, reflecting continued safe-haven demand alongside the improving risk sentiment. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, a key indicator for borrowing costs, is currently floating near 4.06%. The positive premarket activity follows a challenging end to last week. On Friday, October 10, 2025, U.S. stock markets experienced a significant sell-off, driven by heightened U.S.-China trade tensions and the lingering uncertainty from the ongoing federal government shutdown. The S&P 500 ( SPX ) tumbled 2.7% to close at 6,552.51, marking its most significant single-day drop since April. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( IXIC ) plummeted 3.6% to 22,204.43, also experiencing its largest single-day decline since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) slid 1.9% to finish at 45,479.60. All three major indexes ended the week in negative territory. Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) was a notable loser on Friday, with its stock price down 5%. This week is poised to be eventful, despite the continued U.S. government shutdown, which is now entering its third week. The shutdown is expected to delay the release of several key economic data points, including consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI), retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims. The CPI report, for instance, is now anticipated to be published on October 24. However, other scheduled updates, such as industrial production and various manufacturing surveys, are still expected. The Federal Reserve remains a key focus for investors. Markets are currently pricing in a nearly 96% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in October, with an 87% possibility of another reduction in December. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak throughout the week, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson addressing the public today. Their comments will be closely scrutinized for further clues on the central bank's monetary policy path. The third-quarter earnings season officially kicks off this week, with a deluge of reports from major financial institutions and other prominent companies. Investors will be closely watching these releases to gauge corporate health and the broader economic landscape. It's important to note that while U.S. stock markets ( NYSE and Nasdaq) are open today, October 13, for Columbus Day, the U.S. bond markets are closed. Beyond the broader market movements, several individual companies are making headlines. The easing of U.S.-China trade tensions is a significant development, especially after China's September exports surged 8.3% year-over-year, marking the fastest pace in six months. In corporate news, the burgeoning field of quantum computing is gaining significant attention, with major hyperscalers such as Microsoft ( MSFT ), Google ( GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Oracle ( ORCL ), Meta Platforms ( META ), and Tesla ( TSLA ) actively integrating this technology into their infrastructure, positioning it as the ""next technological revolution"". Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca PLC ( AZN ) has reached a drug-pricing agreement with the Trump administration, mirroring a previous deal by Pfizer Inc. ( PFE ) to offer ""most-favored nation"" pricing. Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) is reportedly in discussions to acquire Protagonist Therapeutics Inc. ( PTGX ), with the two companies already collaborating on a treatment for ulcerative colitis. BASF SE ( BASFY ) announced it would sell a majority stake in its coatings unit to Carlyle Group Inc. ( CG ) for $6.7 billion, while retaining a 40% interest.
