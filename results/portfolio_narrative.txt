The portfolio gained 8.81% from September 30 to October 24, 2025, generating $146,380 in profit.
Nestlé SA-REG (NESN.SW) was the largest contributor, advancing 82.72% and adding $90,670 to portfolio value after the company announced roughly 16,000 job cuts and raised its cost-savings target to CHF 3 billion alongside better-than-expected Q3 organic growth, which sent shares sharply higher; the move comprised a 9.63% local gain and a substantial 66.7% FX tailwind [2][3].
L’Oréal (OR.PA) was also a key contributor, rising 16.93% and adding $49,924 as nine-month sales reached €32.8 billion with 3.4% like-for-like growth and the company agreed to acquire Kering’s beauty unit, including Creed and long-term licences for Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta; performance reflected a 1.68% local return and a 15.0% FX boost [4][5][6].
Caterpillar Inc (CAT) gained 9.87%, contributing $36,619, as investors looked ahead to the upcoming Q3 print and the newly announced Nov. 4 Investor Day webcast outlining strategic priorities, despite cautious earnings previews [7][8][9].
On the downside, AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.L) was the primary drag, declining 13.54% and reducing portfolio value by $23,853; despite J.P. Morgan maintaining a Buy rating with a £140 price target and headlines around shares hitting an all-time high on tariff-delay reports, the stock’s 12.07% local gain was more than offset by unfavorable currency movements of -22.9% [10][11].
Home Depot Inc (HD) fell 4.57%, detracting $13,327, as the shares eased despite ongoing dividend appeal and the recently completed $5.5 billion acquisition of GMS Inc. through SRS Distribution [13][15].
JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) declined 4.29%, reducing portfolio value by $10,098, even as Q3 results showed robust revenue growth and a beat versus expectations, with investors focusing on credit costs and expense headwinds [16][18].

Broadly, FX was a major driver this period—Swiss franc and euro strength amplified returns in Nestlé and L’Oréal, while sterling weakness hurt AstraZeneca.
Positioning-wise, Consumer Staples rose 5.8pp to 30.1%, leaving the sleeve materially above its 24% target overweight; Industrials edged to 22.5% versus a 22% target; Information Technology held near its 11% target; while Financials and Consumer Discretionary fell to 12.5% and 15.4% respectively, both now below their 14% and 18% targets, and Health Care slipped to 8.4% versus an 11% target underweight.
